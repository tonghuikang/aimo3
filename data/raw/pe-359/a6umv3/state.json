    "statement": "An infinite number of people (numbered $1$, $2$, $3$, etc.) are lined up to get a room at Hilbert's newest infinite hotel. The hotel contains an infinite number of floors (numbered $1$, $2$, $3$, etc.), and each floor contains an infinite number of rooms (numbered $1$, $2$, $3$, etc.). \n\nInitially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the $n$th person is assigned a room: person $n$ gets the first vacant room in the lowest numbered floor satisfying either of the following:\n\n- the floor is empty\n\n- the floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in that floor is person $m$, then $m + n$ is a perfect square\n\nPerson $1$ gets room $1$ in floor $1$ since floor $1$ is empty.\n\nPerson $2$ does not get room $2$ in floor $1$ since $1 + 2 = 3$ is not a perfect square.\n\nPerson $2$ instead gets room $1$ in floor $2$ since floor $2$ is empty.\n\nPerson $3$ gets room $2$ in floor $1$ since $1 + 3 = 4$ is a perfect square.\n\nEventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.\n\nDefine $P(f, r)$ to be $n$ if person $n$ occupies room $r$ in floor $f$, and $0$ if no person occupies the room. Here are a few examples:\n\n$P(1, 1) = 1$\n\n$P(1, 2) = 3$\n\n$P(2, 1) = 2$\n\n$P(10, 20) = 440$\n\n$P(25, 75) = 4863$\n\n$P(99, 100) = 19454$\n\nFind the sum of all $P(f, r)$ for all positive $f$ and $r$ such that $f \\times r = 71328803586048$ and give the last $8$ digits as your answer.",
