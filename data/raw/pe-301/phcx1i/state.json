    "statement": "Nim is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players take it in turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no stones remain.\n\nWe'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as follows:\n\n- At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.\n\n- On each player's turn, the player may remove any positive number of stones from any single heap.\n\n- The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.\n\nIf $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$, then there is a simple function, which you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself, $X(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ that returns:\n\n- zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually lose; or\n\n- non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually win.\n\nFor example $X(1,2,3) = 0$ because, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size, at which point every move by the current player can be mirrored by the opponent until no stones remain; so the current player loses. To illustrate:\n\n- current player moves to $(1,2,1)$\n\n- opponent moves to $(1,0,1)$\n\n- current player moves to $(0,0,1)$\n\n- opponent moves to $(0,0,0)$, and so wins.\n\nFor how many positive integers $n\u2009\\le\u20092^{30}$ does $X(n,2n,3n) = 0$ ?\n\nGive your answer modulo $99991$."
