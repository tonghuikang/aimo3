    "statement": "A tournament is held with $2^{20}$ runners each of which has a different running speed. In each race, two runners compete against each other with the faster runner always winning the race. The competition consists of $20$ rounds with each runner starting with a score of $0$. In each round, the runners are paired in such a way that in each pair, both runners have the same score at the beginning of the round. The winner of each race in the $i^{\\text{th}}$ round receives $2^{20-i}$ points and the loser gets no points.\n\nAt the end of the tournament, we rank the competitors according to their scores. Let $N$ denote the number of possible orderings of the competitors at the end of the tournament. Let $k$ be the largest positive integer such that $10^k$ divides $N$. What is the remainder when $k$ is divided by $10^{5}$?",
