    "statement": "Consider the following set of dice with nonstandard pips:\n\nDie $A$: $1$ $4$ $4$ $4$ $4$ $4$\n\nDie $B$: $2$ $2$ $2$ $5$ $5$ $5$\n\nDie $C$: $3$ $3$ $3$ $3$ $3$ $6$\n\nA game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The player who rolls the highest value wins.\n\nIf the first player picks die $A$ and the second player picks die $B$ we get\n\n$P(\\text{second player wins}) = 7/12 \\gt 1/2$.\n\nIf the first player picks die $B$ and the second player picks die $C$ we get\n\n$P(\\text{second player wins}) = 7/12 \\gt 1/2$.\n\nIf the first player picks die $C$ and the second player picks die $A$ we get\n\n$P(\\text{second player wins}) = 25/36 \\gt 1/2$.\n\nSo whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick another die and have a larger than $50\\%$ chance of winning.\n\nA set of dice having this property is called a nontransitive set of dice.\n\nWe wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We will assume the following conditions:\n\n- There are three six-sided dice with each side having between $1$ and $N$ pips, inclusive.\n\n- Dice with the same set of pips are equal, regardless of which side on the die the pips are located.\n\n- The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll the same value neither player wins.\n\n- The sets of dice $\\{A,B,C\\}$, $\\{B,C,A\\}$ and $\\{C,A,B\\}$ are the same set.\n\nFor $N = 7$ we find there are $9780$ such sets.\n\nHow many are there for $N = 30$?\n\nGive your answer modulo $99991$.",
