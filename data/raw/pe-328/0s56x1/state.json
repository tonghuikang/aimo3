    "statement": "We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ by asking questions. \nEach number (question) we ask, has a cost equal to the number asked and we get one of three possible answers:\n\n-  \"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\", or\n\n-  \"Yes, that's it!\", or\n\n-  \"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\".\n\nGiven the value of $n$, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) for the worst possible case. E.g.\n\nIf $n=3$, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number \"2\". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost $= 2$).\n\nIf $n=8$, we might decide to use a \"binary search\" type of strategy: Our first question would be \"$\\mathbf 4$\" and if the hidden number is higher than $4$ we will need one or two additional questions.\n\nLet our second question be \"$\\mathbf 6$\". If the hidden number is still higher than $6$, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between $7$ and $8$.\n\nThus, our third question will be \"$\\mathbf 7$\" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be $4+6+7={\\color{red}\\mathbf{17}}$.\n\nWe can improve considerably the worst-case cost for $n=8$, by asking \"$\\mathbf 5$\" as our first question.\n\nIf we are told that the hidden number is higher than $5$, our second question will be \"$\\mathbf 7$\", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of $5+7={\\color{blue}\\mathbf{12}}$).\n\nIf we are told that the hidden number is lower than $5$, our second question will be \"$\\mathbf 3$\" and if the hidden number is lower than $3$ our third question will be \"$\\mathbf 1$\", giving a total cost of $5+3+1={\\color{blue}\\mathbf 9}$.\n\nSince ${\\color{blue}\\mathbf{12}} \\gt {\\color{blue}\\mathbf 9}$, the worst-case cost for this strategy is ${\\color{red}\\mathbf{12}}$. That's better than what we achieved previously with the \"binary search\" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.\n\nSo, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for $n=8$.\n\nLet $C(n)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for $n$, as described above.\n\nThus $C(1) = 0$, $C(2) = 1$, $C(3) = 2$ and $C(8) = 12$.\n\nSimilarly, $C(100) = 400$ and $\\sum \\limits_{n = 1}^{100} C(n) = 17575$.\n\nFind $\\sum \\limits_{n = 1}^{200000} C(n)$.\n\nGive your answer modulo $99991$."
