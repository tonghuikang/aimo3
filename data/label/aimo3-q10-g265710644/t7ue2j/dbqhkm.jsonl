Since second term is positive but < 1, floor yields the integer part of the first term plus maybe zero. However need to ensure that the fractional part of the first term is zero? Actually (2025! * 64/97) is integer because 2025! divisible by 97. So fractional part zero. So floor yields that integer plus zero. So the floor = (2025! * 64/97). Then dividing by 2025! yields exactly 64/97. So indeed g(c) = 64/97 exactly, which is rational with p=64, q=97 (already reduced as 64 and 97 are coprime: gcd(64,97)=1). So p+q = 64+97=161."}}

Let's think: D not allowed means D-1 is prime (i.e., D = prime+1) or D-1=4 (i.e., D=5). Then D-1 is prime p, and D= p+1. Can we represent D-1 = k * m? The condition for triple is D = 1 + k + k\u2113 where \u2113+1 = m. If D-1 is prime p, then the only factorization is 1*p. Since we require k >=2, m >=3, we need p factorization with both >=2 and >=3; if p is prime >=3, then only factorization is 1*p (k=1,m=p), but k must be >=2 (so not allowed).
