For any integer D with all prime factors not equal to 3, we can consider its Carmichael function \u03bb(D) which divides LCM of p_i-1 times some factor. Since 2025! is a multiple of \u03bb(D) for any D with prime factors \u22642025, perhaps? Not exactly. But we can reason: For any D such that each prime factor p satisfies p-1 | 2025!, we have 3^{2025!} \u2261 1 mod p. Then by Chinese remainder theorem, 3^{2025!} \u2261 1 mod D if D is squarefree or perhaps also for prime powers? For prime powers p^e, we need to consider modulo p^e: 3^{\u03c6(p^e)} \u2261 1 mod p^e for p odd not dividing 3. \u03c6(p^e) = p^{e-1}(p-1). If p-1 | 2025! but p^{e-1} may not.
