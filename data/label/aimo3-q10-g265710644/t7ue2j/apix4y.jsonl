Is it possible for gcd(a,N-a) = N/2? Let's check: If gcd = N/2, then N/2 divides a; let a = N/2 * x. Since a < N, x can be 1 only (a = N/2). Then N-a = N/2 * (2 - x) = N/2. For x=1 you get a=b. So cannot have distinct a,b. Could we have gcd = N/2 with a = N/2 * something else? Since a must be integer < N and divisible by N/2, the possibilities are a=N/2 or a=N. a=N would be not allowed since b=0 (not positive). So only a=N/2 results.
