Let's examine N = M / 3 = 3^{2025! - 1}. Then N is still huge (still approx M/3). Then we need three divisors a,b,c of N that sum to n = M + c (approx M). Since N \u2248 M/3, we need sum of three divisors approx M, but each divisor \u2264 N = M/3, so the total max sum is roughly 3*N = M. Exactly 3*N = M. So it's plausible: If we can find three distinct divisors of N that sum to M + c (a bit bigger than M, but at most M+ c), we need sum \u2248 M + small c. Since maximum sum of three distinct divisors of N might be N + N/2 + N/3 \u2248 1.833 N = ~0.611 M. Not enough to reach M. Actually we need to note that the three divisors must be \u2264 N, not > N. So the max sum of three distinct divisors of N is at most N + (largest proper divisor) + (second largest proper divisor). For N composite, largest proper divisor is N/p where p is smallest prime factor >1. Since N is power of 3, its largest proper divisor is N/3. Next largest is N/9. So max sum = N + N/3 + N/9 = N (1 + 1/3 + 1/9) = N*(13/9) \u2248 1.444 N, which is \u2248 0.481 M (since N=M/3). That's even smaller than M. So N cannot be less than M (since sum cannot exceed M). Actually we need sum = M + something positive (~M + c), but the maximum possible sum for N < M is less than M (since N's max sum appears less than 3*N). But we need sum > M, because n = M + c > M. So we definitely need N >= M. Because if N < M, sum of any three divisors \u2264 max sum (approx <3*N, but if N<M, maybe 3*N < M? Actually if N \u2264 M/2, 3*N \u2264 1.5M? But if N is close to M but less, maybe still can sum to M + c? Let's see general bound. For N < M, the sum of three distinct divisors \u2264 N + (N - smallest divisor) + something? Actually the largest sum we can get for N is N + (largest proper divisor) + (second largest proper divisor). Let's denote p = smallest prime divisor >1 of N. For N not a prime power, largest proper divisor is N/p, second largest proper divisor is N/q maybe where q is next smallest divisor? But if N is highly composite, second largest maybe N/q where q is maybe next smallest factor, but still roughly N/p and N/p^2 perhaps. Then sum \u2264 N + N/p + N/p^2 = N*(1 + 1/p + 1/p^2). For p=2, this is N*(1 + 0.5 + 0.25) = 1.75 N. For p=3, N*(1 + 1/3 + 1/9) = 1.444 N. So the sum cannot exceed 1.75N. So if N < M, we need N + N/p + N/p^2 >= M + c. Approx N*(1 + 1/p + 1/p^2) >= M. Means N >= M / (1 + 1/p + 1/p^2). For p=2, denominator 1.75 => N >= M / 1.75 \u2248 0.571 M. So N can be as low as roughly 0.571 M and still sum maybe above M. However it's still less than M. So N can be less than M but maybe still the sum be >M. Does that allow N < M? Let's check with bound when p=2: N >= M/1.75 \u2248 0.571 M. Example, if N = 0.6M, then sum max approx 1.75*0.6M = 1.05M > M. So it's possible. So we cannot conclude N >= M."}}

Let's compute n's factorization for small parts: n = M + c = M + 265,710,644. Since M is huge, not directly factorizable, but the small prime factors dividing n are exactly those primes p <= 2025 (except 3) dividing c+1. So n has at least the prime factors 5,97,103,197. Also may have multiple of those (like high powers?), but n is just M + c not necessarily divisible by squares of those primes. However if p divides c+1, then n \u2261 0 mod p, but does p^2 also divide n? For p^2 \u2264 2025? Wait p^2 could be >2025 perhaps; but exponent reduction mod \u03c6(p^2) may not hold for p^2 dividing M? M is a power of 3, not divisible by p. So M \u2261 1 mod p^2? Not necessarily. Actually the exponent reduction for modulus p^2 uses Carmichael function \u03bb(p^2) = p(p-1). Since exponent 2025! is a multiple of p(p-1) for p \u2264 2025? Let's see: For p up to 2025, p(p-1) \u22642025*2024 \u2248 4 million, well below 2025! huge. So exponent is divisible by p(p-1). Therefore 3^{2025!} \u22611 (mod p^2) for p not dividing 3. So M \u2261 1 mod p^2 for any p not 3 and p^2 \u2264 ??? Actually exponent multiple of \u03c6(p^2)=p(p-1) ensures 3^{exponent} \u2261 1 mod p^2 (since 3 and p coprime). So M \u22611 mod p^2."}}

However we want to find minimal N among all possibilities, maybe using N = 3*d is fairly small relative to n (0.75 n). But could there be smaller N using the approach with s dividing n but s not multiple of 11? Let's compute h(s) for smallest divisors of n: s = 5, 97, 103, 197, 5*97=485, 5*103=515, 5*197=985, 97*103=9991 (coincidentally 99991 is the modulus later in problem, but ok), 97*197=190... let's compute.
