For S > 9, sqrt(S) \u2264 S/3 holds for S\u22659, because S/3 >= sqrt(S) when S >= 9 (since S/3 >= sqrt(S) <=> S >= 9). For S=8, sqrt=2.828, S/3\u22482.666, smallest prime factor =2 <= S/3.

Since K is massive but integer. Since d/M is << 1e-... extremely tiny, the contribution from d/M times K might be small but non-negligible? Actually K = 2025! is extremely large (~ huge 10^~6000?). But maybe K is astronomically large compared to M? Actually M = 3^{K}, where K = 2025!. That's exponential of K. So M is vastly larger than anything like K or d. For K up to 2025! ~ 10^... maybe 10^6000? Actually let's estimate: n! grows roughly (n/e)^n sqrt(2\u03c0n). For n=2025, log10(n!) ~ n log10 n - n log10 e + ... approx = 2025 * (log10 2025 - 0.4343) + ... . log10 2025 \u2248 3.306. So 2025*(2.872) \u2248 5815. So K is about 10^5815. So K ~ 10^5815. Now M = 3^K. That's 10^{K log10 3} ~ 10^{0.4771 K} which is astronomically huge: exponent about 0.4771 * 10^5815 huge. So M is unbelievably larger than K. So K << M enormously. So K * (d/M) is negligible: K * d / M = (K * d) / M << 1. Because M is exponential in K, ratio K/M essentially ~ 0. So floor(K * ((p_odd - 1)/p_odd) * (1 + d/M)) = floor(K * ((p_odd - 1)/p_odd) + \u03b5) where \u03b5 = K * ((p_odd - 1)/p_odd) * (d/M) \u2248 (K * d / M) * (p_odd - 1)/p_odd \u2248 negligible <1. So floor(Kx) = floor(K * ((p_odd - 1)/p_odd) + tiny). Since K * ((p_odd - 1)/p_odd) may not be integer: it's rational. Adding a small epsilon won't change floor unless the fractional part is extremely close to 1 with epsilon pushing over to next integer. But epsilon is astronomically small (<10^{-... huge}) so cannot push across integer boundary unless fractional part is exactly 1 minus something smaller than epsilon. Since epsilon ~ K * d / M, extremely small. So floor will just be floor(K * ((p_odd - 1)/p_odd))."}}
