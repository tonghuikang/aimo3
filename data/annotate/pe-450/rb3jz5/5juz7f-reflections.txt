## Answer: wrong (0)

## Key moments
- Token 175 [insight]: Correctly anchors the problem to rational points on the unit circle (`sin t, cos t ∈ Q`) as the core structural constraint.
- Token 1235 [breakthrough]: Introduces the complex form `x+iy = (R-r)e^{it} + r e^{-i((R-r)/r)t}`, a strong setup for algebraic analysis.
- Token 2445 [insight]: Recognizes brute-force over all `(R,r)` is infeasible for `N=10^6`, so a number-theoretic summation formula is required.
- Token 5179 [insight]: Uses the `C(2500,1000)` sample to inspect arithmetic structure (notably mixed gcd scales), indicating nontrivial denominator behavior.
- Token 9136 [insight]: Reparameterizes with `g = gcd(R-r,r)` and reduced ratios, which is the right normalization direction.
- Token 17052 [questionable statement]: Conjectures integer points likely exist only for `q=1` or `q=2` without a complete proof.
- Token 20196 [mistake]: Treats that conjecture as effectively settled, prematurely excluding broader cases.
- Token 26880 [insight]: Extracts concrete `q=1` point-pattern regularities from brute examples to derive closed-form candidates.
- Token 32756 [breakthrough]: Derives the compact `q=2` contribution pattern `S=2R` for observed small cases.
- Token 38787 [insight]: Builds category-based formulas and correctly plans to validate against known checkpoints (`T(10), T(100), T(1000)`).
- Token 41522 [questionable statement]: Continues with a provisional classification despite unresolved consistency gaps.
- Token 42248 [mistake]: Accepts a bounded-search result giving `T(10)=406`, which already conflicts with the provided anchor `524`.
- Token 48195 [insight]: Verifies provisional `q>2` behavior (`S=R`) on sampled small pairs, but this is not enough to close the global mismatch.
- Token 53522 [insight]: Detects internal inconsistency in the `q=1` formulas and reopens parity-based case analysis.
- Token 55628 [breakthrough]: Refines `q=1` rules to fit many brute examples (`odd p: 4R-2r`, even subcases), improving local fit.
- Token 59362 [insight]: Assembles a baseline plus correction decomposition (`B + delta_A + delta_B`) for fast summation.
- Token 66252 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly notes a theoretical `q=2` formula is still required but does not pivot to a reliable derivation/verification loop.
- Token 74987 [questionable statement]: Assumes no missing `q=2` points in small-`N` enumeration and shifts suspicion toward the prompt.
- Token 76449 [mistake]: Concludes the statement may be inconsistent (“`T(10)=406`”), instead of treating this as a model/search failure.
- Token 76657 [missed opportunity]: Fails to use the contradiction with provided checkpoints as a hard debugging signal.
- Token 77661-84868 [wasted]: Long sequence of speculative formulas, asymptotic guesses, and partial brute-force attempts without resolving the core inconsistency.
- Token 85006 [questionable statement]: Drifts into unsupported answer-guessing under time pressure.
- Token 90914 [mistake]: Abandons the derivation as “unrealistic to finish” without producing a validated computation.
- Token 90987 [final answer]: Commits placeholder `\\boxed{0}`.
