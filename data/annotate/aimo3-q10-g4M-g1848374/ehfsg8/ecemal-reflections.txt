## Answer: wrong (62229)

## Key moments
- Token 346 [insight]: Recognizes that for any chosen divisor triple, the smallest feasible witness integer is the triple's `lcm`.
- Token 497 [breakthrough]: Commits to the correct global objective `f(n)=min lcm(a,b,c)` over distinct `a+b+c=n`.
- Token 6118 [insight]: Re-parameterizes via `L=S-(a+b)` with divisibility constraints, a useful structure for systematic search.
- Token 14504 [breakthrough]: Obtains the strong `5M` case candidate with ratio `2/3`, setting up the correct `f(5M)` value.
- Token 19001 [verification]: Correctly computes `g(4M)` from `f(5M)=(10/3)M` and checks the floor is exact because `3 | 2025!`.
- Token 22152 [questionable statement]: Restricts the second case to solutions with witness of form `X=kM`, which is an extra assumption not required by the definition of `f`.
- Token 22249 [mistake]: Builds the optimization entirely inside that restricted `kM` model, excluding smaller valid constructions for `M+1848374`.
- Token 22324-29160 [wasted]: Long exhaustive search for minimal `k=lcm(u,v)` is internally consistent but only solves the wrong restricted problem.
- Token 31529 [verification]: Performs an exhaustiveness check over `j,m` loops, but this only validates the restricted search space.
- Token 31901 [final answer]: Finalizes `\boxed{62229}`, so the trace ends on the wrong value.
