## Answer: correct (373)

## Key moments
- Token 2021 [insight]: Reframes `f(n)` as minimizing `lcm(a,b,c)` over distinct triples with sum `n`.
- Token 6195 [missed opportunity]: Over-commits to triples that include `1`, delaying a cleaner global ratio argument.
- Token 12893 [insight]: Introduces the normalized ratio view `L/(a+b+L)` with `a,b|L`, setting up an extremal-divisor approach.
- Token 13394 [breakthrough]: Identifies the key low-ratio benchmark (`6/11`) from divisor structure (`L/2`,`L/3`,`L`) and uses it as a search baseline.
- Token 15878 [verification]: Checks divisibility constraints (notably mod `11`) to rule out applying the `6/11` pattern directly to the target sums.
- Token 24995 [wasted]: Extended pattern-guessing around `3/5` and small-case behavior before locking to precise feasibility conditions.
- Token 34761 [insight]: Switches to the `D`, `D1`, `D2` feasibility filter for candidate `(m,n)` pairs tied to divisors of `N`.
- Token 38173 [questionable statement]: Suggests `3/5` is “probably” minimal based mainly on guaranteed factor `5`, without fully enforcing both integrality constraints.
- Token 38241 [mistake]: Temporarily concludes `f(N)=(3/5)N`, which is invalid for the actual divisibility conditions.
- Token 34761-40507 [wasted]: Long detour through infeasible low-ratio candidates before the correct admissible pair is isolated.
- Token 46015 [insight]: Isolates `(m,n)=(2,16)` as the best feasible low pair with `D1=25` dividing `N`.
- Token 47528 [breakthrough]: Commits to `f(N)=(16/25)N` for `N=M+1848374`, unlocking `g(1848374)=16/25`.
- Token 48079 [verification]: Verifies the floor term is exact (`(16/25)2025!` integer and epsilon from `c/M` is < 1).
- Token 52756 [final answer]: Finalizes `\boxed{373}`, which is correct.
