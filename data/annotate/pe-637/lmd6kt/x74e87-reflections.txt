## Answer: wrong (23665)

## Key moments
- Token 693 [insight]: Uses the provided `g(100,10,3)=3302` as a sanity checkpoint for any proposed model.
- Token 2834 [questionable statement]: Claims numbers up to `10^7` need at most two steps in both bases, effectively assuming `f(n,B)` only takes values `0/1/2`.
- Token 3781 [mistake]: Hard-commits to the simplified rule `f=0` if `n<B`, `f=1` if digit sum `<B`, otherwise `f=2`, eliminating real `f=3` cases.
- Token 8705 [questionable statement]: Reduces the whole comparison to threshold booleans `S10<10` and `S3<3`, treating them as sufficient statistics for equality.
- Token 9498 [mistake]: Derives mismatch logic as pure XOR of those threshold tests, propagating the wrong `f` model into the main computation.
- Token 11502 [questionable statement]: Builds the final summation directly from the XOR mismatch formula without re-validating the missing `f=3` branch.
- Token 11720 [verification]: Checks `g(100)=3302`; it passes and falsely reinforces the flawed simplification.
- Token 12837 [verification]: Adds more small-range consistency checks, but all remain inside the same incorrect model.
- Token 13502 [missed opportunity]: Skips exact partition-based validation on medium inputs, where the dropped `f=3` behavior could have been detected.
- Token 14093 [mistake]: Treats `23665` as confirmed despite only model-internal cross-checks.
- Token 14534 [verification]: Recomputes modulo via mismatch-sum algebra, but this is still a self-check under the same faulty assumptions.
- Token 14627 [final answer]: Commits to `\\boxed{23665}`, which is incorrect.
