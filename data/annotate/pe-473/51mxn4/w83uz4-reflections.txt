## Answer: correct (96175)

## Key moments
- Token 533 [insight]: Recognizes the no-consecutive-1 constraint applies across the point (exponents 0 and -1), not just within each side.
- Token 1887 [breakthrough]: Derives that palindrome symmetry forces exponent 0 and exponent -1 bits to match, so the shared bit must be 0.
- Token 2926 [insight]: Writes the core value map \(V(L)=\sum d_i(\varphi^i+\varphi^{-(i+1)})\), enabling coefficient-based reasoning.
- Token 11915 [verification]: Runs early small-\(n\) generation checks to inspect whether constructed candidates match expected palindrome behavior.
- Token 14036 [breakthrough]: Proves the only integer palindrome without a point is 1, so all other qualifying integers must come from point-centered palindromes.
- Token 21996 [questionable statement]: Commits to large recursive enumeration/backtracking as the main route to scale up to \(10^{10}\) despite weak pruning.
- Token 27720 [missed opportunity]: Notes that \(V\)-based pruning is weak/non-monotone but continues down similarly expensive recursion paths.
- Token 32598 [insight]: Identifies the high-end adjacency handling issue and restructures recursion around forced boundary bits.
- Token 36282 [verification]: Confirms the method on the benchmark case \(N=1000\) and recovers the known sum 4345.
- Token 36282-45069 [wasted]: Long cycle of recursion/pruning variants mostly repeats the same bottleneck and yields little new progress.
- Token 37658 [mistake]: The earlier scalability assumption fails; recursion at larger lengths/time bounds is too slow and stalls.
- Token 44962 [insight]: Realizes pruning must exploit stronger structure (selection-spacing constraints), motivating a different formulation.
- Token 53733 [insight]: Recasts valid constructions as constrained selections with minimum spacing among weighted components.
- Token 54405 [breakthrough]: Reduces the search to constrained subset sums of Lucas-based weights (plus special handling for 1 and the base 2-case), making full-range evaluation tractable.
- Token 58322 [verification]: Cross-validates the weight method against smaller-limit brute-force behavior before trusting the large-limit run.
- Token 60492 [missed opportunity]: Attempts another expensive original-recursion check at large scale after already validating the faster method.
- Token 60559-61802 [wasted]: Additional heavy recursive check times out and does not materially change conclusions.
- Token 64493 [final answer]: Commits to the boxed final result \(96175\).
