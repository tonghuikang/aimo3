## Answer: wrong (23347)

## Key moments
- Token 4163 [insight]: Switches from pure speculation to empirical small-n exploration, which is the right direction for extracting structure.
- Token 10454-13233 [wasted]: Long graph/packing reformulations and asymptotic guesses do not produce a checkable invariant or exact recurrence.
- Token 13834 [breakthrough]: Introduces a concrete greedy-with-conflict-check construction, giving an executable pipeline for candidate S sets.
- Token 20612 [questionable statement]: Treats greedy-optimality as likely true without proving optimality against exact search beyond tiny cases.
- Token 28199 [missed opportunity]: After fixing one greedy implementation bug, still uses greedy outputs as the primary oracle instead of validating against an exact solver on moderate n.
- Token 31107 [questionable statement]: Generalizes from samples that uncovered numbers are exactly of the form 6 times a greedy base.
- Token 37706 [mistake]: Promotes that empirical pattern to the identity f(n) = n - b(floor(n/6)), which is not generally valid.
- Token 39102 [questionable statement]: Uses agreement with the same greedy-based process as “verification,” creating circular confirmation.
- Token 39798 [mistake]: Builds modular recursion and final computation on the incorrect recurrence, preserving the bias.
- Token 40049 [missed opportunity]: Tests only against the derived greedy pipeline instead of independent exact values where the recurrence would fail.
- Token 40378 [final answer]: Commits to 23347.
