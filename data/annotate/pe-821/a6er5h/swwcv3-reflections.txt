## Answer: wrong (23347)

## Key moments
- Token 4146 [insight]: Correctly decomposes the problem into independent core components indexed by numbers coprime to 6.
- Token 5647-10823 [wasted]: Extended graph/lattice reinterpretations repeat the same structure without narrowing to a provable counting invariant.
- Token 15183 [breakthrough]: Implements component-level DP machinery to compute local optima instead of relying only on heuristic constructions.
- Token 21585 [insight]: Rewrites global deficit as a sum of per-core uncovered counts, which is the right aggregation framework.
- Token 23302 [breakthrough]: Fixes an earlier definition error by using u(N)=P(N)-g(N) rather than N-g(N).
- Token 25419 [insight]: Spots a clean empirical threshold pattern in u(N), motivating a closed-form hypothesis.
- Token 26097 [questionable statement]: Generalizes from finite data that increments occur exactly at odd-odd exponent points.
- Token 26473 [mistake]: Promotes that pattern to the identity u(N)=count_oddodd(N) without proving it for all N.
- Token 26755 [questionable statement]: Rewrites D(n) using the unproven u(N) identity as if it were already established.
- Token 27131 [mistake]: Concludes D(n) is exactly the count of integers with odd v2 and odd v3, which undercounts the true deficit.
- Token 28970 [missed opportunity]: Verification checks only consistency of the derived formula with itself/small internal tests, not against an independent exact oracle at moderate n.
- Token 29760 [final answer]: Commits to 23347.
