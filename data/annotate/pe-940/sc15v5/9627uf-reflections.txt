## Answer: correct (969134784)

## Key moments
- Token 466 [insight]: Identifies that `f_50` is huge, so `A(f_i,f_j)` needs a structural/closed-form route rather than grid DP.
- Token 466-938 [wasted]: Long modulus/Fibonacci-numerology detour that does not contribute to the final computation method.
- Token 1912 [insight]: Solves for `A(0,2)` and `A(0,3)` from coupled recurrences, revealing how hidden first-row terms are constrained.
- Token 2668 [breakthrough]: Derives `B_{n+1}=B_n+3B_{n-1}` for `B_n=A(0,n)`, creating a usable 1D recurrence backbone.
- Token 4357-5051 [wasted]: Shift-operator/generating-function exploration is extended but abandoned before yielding the final algorithm.
- Token 5657 [questionable statement]: Assumes the `T`-map preserves the column recurrence without carefully handling finite truncation effects in testing.
- Token 6195 [mistake]: Incorrectly concludes `T(B)` fails the recurrence due to a flawed finite-sequence check.
- Token 6624 [insight]: Notices the contradiction with explicit `A(1,n)` values and correctly suspects the test setup, not the recurrence itself.
- Token 8295 [breakthrough]: Re-establishes consistency and models each column as a linear combination of the two characteristic-root modes.
- Token 8932 [insight]: Tracks how applying `T` updates modal coefficients via factors `(1+λ1)` and `(1+λ2)`.
- Token 9309 [breakthrough]: Obtains the closed-form expression for `A(m,n)` in conjugate-root form.
- Token 10164 [insight]: Pivots from algebraic-number arithmetic to integer recurrences/matrices for robust modular computation.
- Token 10799 [insight]: Proposes `A(m,n)=c_m B_n + d_m B_{n+1}` as the computational basis decomposition.
- Token 11354 [breakthrough]: Derives the coefficient recurrence (`c_{m+1}=c_m+3d_m`, `d_{m+1}=c_m+2d_m`) and matrix form for fast exponentiation.
- Token 12353 [insight]: Rewrites each target term as `A(f_i,f_j)=C_i B_{f_j}+D_i B_{f_j+1}`.
- Token 12467 [breakthrough]: Factorizes the double sum into products of four one-dimensional sums.
- Token 14104 [verification]: Runs the implementation checks for `S(3)` and `S(5)` and matches the provided values.
- Token 14958 [verification]: Adds an independent direct double-loop cross-check against the optimized formula.
- Token 15276 [verification]: Recomputes `K=50` with the direct method and confirms the same modulus result.
- Token 15338 [missed opportunity]: Final validation remains empirical; no compact proof is added after the computational agreement checks.
- Token 15406 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{969134784}`.
