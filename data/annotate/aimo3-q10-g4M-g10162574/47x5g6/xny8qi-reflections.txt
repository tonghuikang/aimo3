## Answer: wrong (56915)

## Key moments
- Token 123 [breakthrough]: Correctly sets up `g(c)` as a floored scaled ratio and frames the two required evaluations.
- Token 5513 [breakthrough]: Develops a divisor-parameterized form for `f(n)` and starts separating prime/composite behavior.
- Token 10957 [mistake]: Treats odd-`n` behavior with an over-aggressive shortcut (`f(n)=n-3`-style path), introducing a wrong baseline that later contaminates the final formulas.
- Token 14949 [breakthrough]: Improves to a “smallest divisor >= 3” rule for `S=n-1`, but still stays inside the same incorrect global model.
- Token 21761 [missed opportunity]: Acknowledges earlier calculations must be recomputed, but does not revisit whether the `S=n-1` reduction itself is valid.
- Token 30301-39581 [wasted]: Extensive prime-search/modular computation for `m1,m2` and floor terms consumes many tokens without fixing the foundational modeling error.
- Token 46174 [mistake]: Locks into the derived wrong expressions (including `15/4`-type first-term behavior), leading directly to the incorrect sum.
- Token 54582 [verification]: Performs consistency checks (gcd/reduction) that confirm internal arithmetic only.
- Token 54867 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{56915}`.
