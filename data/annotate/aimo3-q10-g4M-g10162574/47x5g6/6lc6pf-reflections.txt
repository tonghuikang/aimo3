## Answer: wrong (56915)

## Key moments
- Token 492 [breakthrough]: Reformulates the task as minimizing `lcm(a,b,c)` over triples summing to the target, which is a useful structural reduction.
- Token 1117 [mistake]: Commits to fixing one divisor as `1` and reducing to a two-number `N-1` split, pruning away valid better three-divisor constructions.
- Token 8384 [breakthrough]: Correctly computes modular constraints (e.g., parity/mod 4 behavior) to reason about candidate divisors for the second term.
- Token 17036 [missed opportunity]: Notices inconsistencies in modular expressions but does not step back to re-validate the core `f(n)` model, so the main error persists.
- Token 24736-30625 [wasted]: Spends a long span on delicate floor/remainder algebra and targeted factor search built on the incorrect `N-1` framework.
- Token 34379 [verification]: Runs numeric checks and gcd reduction that only verify arithmetic consistency of the derived (but wrong) formula.
- Token 34457 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{56915}`.
