## Answer: correct (701)

## Key moments
- Token 10 [breakthrough]: Starts from the correct `lcm` minimization interpretation of `f(n)`.
- Token 8247 [missed opportunity]: Takes a detour through an over-parameterized divisor case split that delays direct use of known low-ratio templates.
- Token 16013 [breakthrough]: Re-centers on expressing `f(M+c)` through ratio minimization over valid divisor sums.
- Token 24008 [breakthrough]: Moves to a divisor-compatibility framing that clarifies which low-ratio constructions are admissible.
- Token 32018 [breakthrough]: Uses the corrected divisor/range logic to support the `10/3` first-term value.
- Token 40003-48019 [wasted]: Repeats several candidate-family checks after the key ratios are already identified.
- Token 56014 [verification]: Final arithmetic consolidation to `560/141` is checked explicitly.
- Token 62236 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{701}`.
