## Answer: correct (701)

## Key moments
- Token 430 [breakthrough]: Correctly reduces the objective to minimizing `lcm(a,b,c)` for fixed-sum triples.
- Token 7018 [missed opportunity]: Spends time on generic asymptotics before locking onto divisor-specific low-ratio candidates.
- Token 14123 [breakthrough]: Establishes a concrete low-ratio comparison set and starts isolating which candidate sums can actually divide the targets.
- Token 21120 [breakthrough]: Narrows the second-term divisor set and isolates the effective `47` route.
- Token 28467 [wasted]: Spends a sizeable segment re-deriving scale-invariance consequences that were already sufficient for the `47` branch.
- Token 31238 [mistake]: Detects a contradiction with an earlier first-term value and acknowledges a wrong intermediate track.
- Token 32351 [breakthrough]: Repairs the first term by using the `t=9` construction, giving `f(5M)/M=10/3`.
- Token 35761-36580 [verification]: Performs a full end-to-end recheck of divisor constraints, floors, and fraction reduction.
- Token 39723 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{701}`.
