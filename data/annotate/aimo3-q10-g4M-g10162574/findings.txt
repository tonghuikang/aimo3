# Findings for aimo3-q10-g4M-g10162574

## Problem
Norwegian number problem: f(n) = smallest integer with 3 distinct divisors summing to n.
Compute g(4M) + g(10162574) where M = 3^{2025!}.

## Correct Answer: 701

## Correct Approach
Key insight: f(n) = min_{a+b+c=n} lcm(a,b,c) can be optimized using scaling.

1. Define ratio r(s) = f(s)/s = min lcm / sum for base triples
2. f(n) = n * min_{s|n} r(s) where s divides n
3. Base triple (1,2,6) for sum 9: lcm=6, ratio 2/3
4. Base triple (2,15,30) for sum 47: lcm=30, ratio 30/47

For g(4M): n = 5M = M + 4M
- 5M divisible by 9 (since M = 3^{2025!})
- Use scaling of (1,2,6): triple becomes (d, 2d, 6d) where d = 5M/9
- f(5M) = 5M * (2/3) = (10/3)M
- g(4M) = 10/3

For g(10162574): n = M + 10162574
- n is divisible by 47 (since M + 10162574 ≡ 0 mod 47)
- n is NOT divisible by 7, 11, 13, etc. (which would give lower ratios)
- Smallest prime factor giving ratio < 1 is 47
- f(n) = n * (30/47)
- g(10162574) = 30/47

Sum = 10/3 + 30/47 = (470 + 90)/141 = 560/141
p = 560, q = 141, gcd = 1
p + q = 701

## Wrong Approach (leads to 56915)
The wrong traces fix a=1 and reduce to f(N) = min lcm(b,c) for b+c=N-1.

This gives f(N) = S - d_max where:
- S = N - 1
- d_max = largest proper divisor of S not equal to S/2

This approach MISSES the key insight that:
- Better triples like (1,2,6), (2,3,6), (1,2,4) give lower ratios
- Scaling these base triples can produce smaller lcm values
- The correct formula is f(n) = n * min_{s|n} r(s)

The error comes from assuming the triple (1, b, c) is always optimal.
In reality, triples like (d, 2d, 6d) with sum 9d give ratio 2/3 < any ratio achievable with (1, b, N-1-b) for large N.

## Wrong Approach Variant (also leads to 56915)
Another failure mode rewrites the problem via `S = n-1` and uses:
- `t = smallest divisor of S greater than 2`
- `f(n) = S * (t-1)/t`

This produces values like `g(4M)=15/4-1/2025!` and a large-floor arithmetic chain ending at `56915`.

Why it fails:
- It optimizes a restricted divisor-parameterization, not the true global minimum over all valid triples.
- It misses lower-ratio constructions reachable by scaling known base triples (especially the `9 -> 2/3` route for `5M`).
