## Answer: wrong (2256318)

## Key moments
- Token 143 [insight]: Correctly reframes the condition as a two-spike convolution/correlation objective.
- Token 3059 [breakthrough]: Establishes the useful Laurent-polynomial divisibility view (`A` must factor a binomial).
- Token 7937 [questionable statement]: Uses an over-general classification `±x^e * ∏Φ_{2t}` without enforcing the shared-`v2` requirement for factors from one `1+x^m`.
- Token 11254 [mistake]: Counts subsets from a single global set of 68 cyclotomic candidates, mixing incompatible `v2` families.
- Token 11287 [mistake]: Applies the shift-weight formula on that invalid subset universe, compounding the overcount.
- Token 13508 [mistake]: Reasserts the same global-subset total as final, instead of partitioning by compatible families.
- Token 17659 [missed opportunity]: Rechecks only bookkeeping details (empty subset/off-by-one) and misses the structural admissibility error.
- Token 20031 [verification]: Performs uniqueness checks for representations, but these checks cannot fix the already wrong subset space.
- Token 20263 [final answer]: Outputs incorrect `\boxed{2256318}`.
