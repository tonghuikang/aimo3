## Answer: correct (86774)

## Key moments
- Token 144 [insight]: Interprets the target as a two-spike correlation condition in the shift index.
- Token 3265 [breakthrough]: Reaches the main reduction: after monomial handling, the core factor must divide some `x^m+1`.
- Token 6340 [insight]: Identifies the shared-2-adic constraint on admissible cyclotomic factors.
- Token 6813 [breakthrough]: Locks the full admissible form `α = ±x^v D` with one `v2` family and support bound `v+deg(D) <= 50`.
- Token 12023 [verification]: Corrects duplicate counting of the empty subset across the six families.
- Token 12785 [verification]: Recomputes the empty-subset adjustment and confirms the corrected aggregate.
- Token 17488 [verification]: Verifies monomial and sign edge cases (`±x^v`) are included exactly once per placement/sign.
- Token 17793 [verification]: Final consistency check on excluded odd cyclotomic indices and index-difference handling.
- Token 17804 [final answer]: Outputs `\boxed{86774}`.
