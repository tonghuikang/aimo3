## Answer: correct (86774)

## Key moments
- Token 96 [insight]: Recasts the shift inner product as convolution/correlation with a reversed sequence, enabling algebraic handling.
- Token 4131 [breakthrough]: Converts the task to classifying factors of a binomial (`x^k+x^l`), i.e., shifted/signed divisors of `1+x^d`.
- Token 11240 [insight]: Identifies the 2-adic condition linking admissible cyclotomic indices to one shared `v2` layer.
- Token 11449 [breakthrough]: Fixes the core structure: valid non-monomial factors come from one common-`v2` family, not mixed families.
- Token 17374 [verification]: Verifies subset uniqueness and corrects duplicate counting of the empty subset across families.
- Token 18534 [verification]: Confirms the `±` sign contributes a clean factor of 2 without collisions.
- Token 19591 [verification]: Checks sufficiency by explicitly reconstructing a witness `β` from `D | (1+x^d)` and shift.
- Token 20227 [verification]: Performs final edge checks (monomial/unit handling and divisibility details) before committing.
- Token 29653-32434 [wasted]: Spends a long late segment rechecking settled edge cases without changing the argument or count.
- Token 32614 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{86774}`.
