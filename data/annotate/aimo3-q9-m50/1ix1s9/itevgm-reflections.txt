## Answer: wrong (8722)

## Key moments
- Token 301 [insight]: Correctly converts the shift-inner-product condition into a convolution/polynomial divisibility setup.
- Token 3093 [questionable statement]: Narrows the count to monic divisors of `1+x^m` and implicitly assumes one divisor corresponds to one `α`.
- Token 12579 [mistake]: Uses that wrong target directly and computes `2*(1+Σ(DP(e)-1)) = 8722`.
- Token 12612 [missed opportunity]: Runs checks on subset counting but misses the required shift multiplicity factor `(51-degree)` from support placement.
- Token 13133 [mistake]: Reasserts `4361 -> 8722` instead of switching to weighted counting over all shifts.
- Token 14883 [questionable statement]: Keeps treating divisor uniqueness as the entire objective, reinforcing the same counting model.
- Token 15958 [insight]: Correctly derives same-`v2` compatibility for valid cyclotomic subsets, but this only supports the incomplete metric.
- Token 16548 [mistake]: Finalizes the same undercount after additional validation attempts.
- Token 16622 [final answer]: Commits to incorrect `\boxed{8722}`.
