## Answer: wrong (333333208685812397)

## Key moments
- Token 291 [insight]: Correctly reduces the task to angular containment: triangles are valid only when points are not all inside one semicircle.
- Token 5726 [verification]: Early implementation checks match `C(8)=20` and `C(600)=8950634`, validating the basic pipeline.
- Token 6392 [verification]: `C(40000)` misses the provided benchmark by 1, revealing a real counting defect.
- Token 6533 [missed opportunity]: Treats the mismatch mainly as numeric-boundary noise instead of forcing a full combinatorial correctness audit.
- Token 6970 [insight]: Recognizes float boundary instability and motivates switching to integer cross-product logic.
- Token 8920 [breakthrough]: Moves to integer geometry for sorting/window checks, improving numerical robustness.
- Token 17388 [questionable statement]: Notes a critical ambiguity: duplicated vectors plus `cross=0` can conflate angle `0` with wrapped `2π` cases.
- Token 17459 [mistake]: Continues with the same `cross>=0` window counting despite the unresolved wrap/collinearity ambiguity, keeping an overcounted bad-triple total.
- Token 17685-26089 [wasted]: Long detour across edge-case speculation and repeated re-derivations without resolving the benchmark failure.
- Token 32721 [questionable statement]: Assumes the authoritative `C(40000)=2666610948988` value is likely a typo.
- Token 32838 [mistake]: Commits the 2,000,000 result from a method that still fails a provided validation point.
- Token 32901 [final answer]: Outputs `\boxed{333333208685812397}`, which is incorrect.
