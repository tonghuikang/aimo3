## Answer: correct (43260)

## Key moments
- Token 170 [insight]: Identifies the shuffle as a perfect out-shuffle and writes the position mapping for left/right half cards.
- Token 437 [breakthrough]: Converts the shuffle period to a number-theory statement `s(n) = ord_{n-1}(2)`.
- Token 578 [verification]: Validates the mapping on the prompt’s examples (`n=52` and `n=86`, both giving order 8).
- Token 1136 [insight]: Reframes the target as odd `m=n-1` with `ord_m(2)=60`, implying `m | (2^60-1)` and exclusion of smaller divisors of 60.
- Token 1197 [breakthrough]: Uses CRT structure: for composite `m`, the order is the LCM of orders on prime-power factors, enabling divisor-based filtering.
- Token 1834 [verification]: Factors `2^60-1` into `3^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 31 * 41 * 61 * 151 * 331 * 1321`.
- Token 3566 [verification]: Computes `sum_{ord_m(2)=60}(m+1) mod 99991` and gets `43260`.
- Token 4355-4502 [wasted]: Re-derives the already-established necessity `m | (2^60-1)` and completeness of divisor enumeration without adding new progress.
- Token 5022 [verification]: Cross-checks methodology against the statement `sum_{s(n)=8} n = 412`, which matches.
- Token 5318 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{43260}`.
