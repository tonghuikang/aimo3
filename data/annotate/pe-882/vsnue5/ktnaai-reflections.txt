## Answer: correct (84456)

## Key moments
- Token 1425 [insight]: Reframes the position as a partisan CGT sum over independent number-components with multiplicity, which sets up value-based analysis.
- Token 9300 [breakthrough]: Switches to computing per-number game values `G(i)` as dyadic rationals via left/right option bounds.
- Token 13237 [verification]: Confirms the recursive value engine on small canonical cases (e.g., `G(2)={0|1}=1/2`).
- Token 19136 [insight]: Notices stable structure in computed values (powers of two / all-ones patterns), reinforcing that the values are consistent numbers.
- Token 27245 [breakthrough]: Reduces the target to `S(n)=ceil(\sum_{i=1}^n i*G(i))` and shifts to scalable computation for `n=100000`.
- Token 27781 [verification]: Recomputes `S(2), S(5), S(10)` and matches all provided checkpoints.
- Token 29089 [verification]: Computes `S(100000)=15800662276` and `S(100000) mod 99991 = 84456`.
- Token 30361 [verification]: Cross-checks with a second integer/fraction implementation and gets the same large-`n` result.
- Token 30463-30660 [wasted]: Spends extra tokens re-deriving the pass-as-`-1` argument after numeric and implementation checks were already sufficient.
- Token 30799 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{84456}`, which is correct.
