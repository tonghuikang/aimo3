## Answer: correct (84456)

## Key moments
- Token 612 [insight]: Identifies the game as partisan with Right-only passes and frames the task as computing the minimal skip budget for Right.
- Token 7366 [insight]: Separates naive counting from true CGT value analysis, avoiding a pure parity/count shortcut.
- Token 10119 [breakthrough]: Connects skips to numeric game-value shifts and targets a value-threshold formulation for `S(n)`.
- Token 14233 [verification]: Runs early computational checks on small cases to test whether the value-based approach is numerically plausible.
- Token 18702 [insight]: Uses temperature/number intuition to justify why a dyadic-number recursion is the right computational object.
- Token 22202 [breakthrough]: Commits to bottom-up computation of dyadic `v(i)` and aggregation as `\sum i\,v(i)`.
- Token 24944 [verification]: Expands computed single-number values and checks consistency on additional examples.
- Token 27192 [insight]: Extracts a recurrence-oriented view from binary edits, enabling efficient DP evaluation.
- Token 30672 [breakthrough]: Implements the optimized numeric pipeline (dyadic bounds + integer-safe accumulation) for large `n`.
- Token 31695 [verification]: Reproduces checkpoint values `S(2), S(5), S(10)` before scaling.
- Token 31740 [verification]: Computes `S(100000)=15800662276` and derives modulo `99991` as `84456`.
- Token 32145-32203 [wasted]: Performs an additional full arithmetic re-check after the result was already confirmed.
- Token 33118 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{84456}`, which is correct.
