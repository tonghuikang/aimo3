## Answer: correct (922058210)

## Key moments
- Token 164 [insight]: The trace frames `s(n)` as a minimization over decimal length first, then lexicographic order within that length.
- Token 664 [breakthrough]: It converts the digit construction into a closed form, `s(n) = (r+1)10^{d-1}-1`.
- Token 1177 [insight]: It recognizes a 9-number block structure (`d` fixed, `r=1..9`) for summing `S(k)`.
- Token 1747 [breakthrough]: It derives the partial-block formula `((t+1)(t+2)/2 - 1)10^{d-1} - t`.
- Token 2387 [verification]: The full+partial decomposition is validated against the anchor `S(20)=1074`.
- Token 2754 [insight]: Full blocks are rewritten as a geometric-series expression `54*sum(10^{d-1}) - 9B`.
- Token 2852 [breakthrough]: That geometric sum is simplified to `6*10^B - 6 - 9B`, making large-`k` evaluation practical.
- Token 3070 [insight]: Defining `C(r)` sets up a unified treatment for both `r=0` and `r>0`.
- Token 3317 [breakthrough]: The trace lands on a single closed form `S(k) = (6 + C(r))10^B - 6 - 9B - r`.
- Token 3528 [verification]: Edge-case checking (`k=1`) confirms the unified formula also works in the smallest block.
- Token 5423 [missed opportunity]: It postpones direct validation of a computed intermediate (`S(13)`), then later returns to broader validation.
- Token 6127 [verification]: Brute-force prefix checks against the formula confirm correctness on small ranges.
- Token 6546 [verification]: Exact-vs-mod consistency checks reinforce that the modular implementation is faithful.
- Token 7330-7855 [wasted]: After the result is already stable, the trace spends many tokens on repeated confidence checks and output-planning loops.
- Token 9031 [final answer]: The trace commits to `\boxed{922058210}`.
