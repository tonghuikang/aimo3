# Problem: pe-626

## Correct Answer
695577663 (mod 1,001,001,011)

## Correct Approach

Treat `c(n)` as the number of orbits of `n x n` binary matrices under:
- row permutations
- column permutations
- row flips
- column flips

Use Burnside:
- For fixed row/column permutations `(σ, τ)`, with row-cycle lengths `a_i` and column-cycle lengths `b_j`, cell orbits count is
  `O(σ,τ) = Σ_{i,j} gcd(a_i, b_j)`.
- Fixed-point consistency with flips reduces to parity variables on row/column cycles.
- This yields a linear GF(2) system whose rank `r(σ,τ)` determines how many flip choices are valid.
- After simplifying the flip-count and Burnside normalization, contribution per `(σ,τ)` is `2^{O(σ,τ) - r(σ,τ)}`.

So:
- `c(n) = (1/(n!)^2) * Σ_{σ,τ in S_n} 2^{O(σ,τ) - r(σ,τ)}`.

Then group permutations by cycle type partitions `(λ, μ)`:
- weight each by permutation counts `n!/z_λ`, `n!/z_μ`, where `z_λ = Π i^{m_i} m_i!`.
- compute `O` and `r` from those cycle structures.

This reproduces the provided checks:
- `c(3)=3`
- `c(5)=39`
- `c(8)=656108`

and gives:
- `c(20) mod 1,001,001,011 = 695577663`.

## Wrong Approach(es)

### Wrong Answer: 0
- A failed path overcomplicated the quotient/nullity derivation, repeatedly changed formulas after local discrepancy checks, and abandoned the validated Burnside computation.
- It concluded with a placeholder boxed `0` instead of returning the computed orbit count.

### Failure Pattern
- Turning a verified computational route into unresolved theoretical debugging late in the trace.
- Treating unresolved implementation/model mismatches as proof the main method was invalid, without reverting to already validated checks (`c(3), c(5), c(8)`).
