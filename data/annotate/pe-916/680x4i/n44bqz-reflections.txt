## Answer: correct (877789135)

## Key moments
- Token 567 [insight]: Converts the LIS/LDS constraints into RSK shape constraints and narrows allowed shapes to `(n,n)` and `(n+1,n-1)`.
- Token 919 [breakthrough]: Reframes the count as `P(n) = (f^{(n,n)})^2 + (f^{(n+1,n-1)})^2`, reducing the problem to tableau counts.
- Token 1018 [questionable statement]: Starts hook-length derivation with uncertainty (`???`) around the exact 2-row formula, creating a risk of a wrong formula.
- Token 2423 [verification]: Checks the derived formula at `n=2` and recovers `P(2)=13`, confirming the combinatorial setup.
- Token 3985 [missed opportunity]: After obtaining a closed form in terms of `binom(2n,n)`, delays practical computation instead of immediately benchmarking the direct factorial loop.
- Token 4035-10522 [wasted]: Long detour through speculative complexity/theory discussions without advancing toward an executable computation path.
- Token 11220-15896 [wasted]: Extended modular-constant manipulations and congruence exploration that do not simplify the central binomial evaluation.
- Token 17664 [questionable statement]: Assumes a direct `2e8`-step modular loop is too slow in this environment without measurement.
- Token 24562 [mistake]: Incorrectly concludes that running a `200,000,000`-iteration modular loop is infeasible, sending the trace into unnecessary alternatives.
- Token 26472 [insight]: Decides to benchmark loop speed directly, giving evidence to validate or refute the feasibility assumption.
- Token 26957 [breakthrough]: Implements the straightforward factorial sweep to compute `binom(2n,n) mod p`, which is actually fast enough here.
- Token 27588 [verification]: Validates implementation against given checkpoints `P(2)=13` and `P(10)=45265702`.
- Token 28090 [verification]: Executes the full `n=10^8` computation and obtains `877789135`.
- Token 28418 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{877789135}` as the final result.
