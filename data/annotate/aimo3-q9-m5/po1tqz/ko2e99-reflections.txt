## Answer: correct (58)

## Key moments
- Token 2180 [insight]: Encodes the correlation constraint with generating functions, linking coefficients to `A(x)B(1/x)`.
- Token 2971 [breakthrough]: Reduces the task to divisibility of a two-term binomial (`1+x^D`) in the Laurent-polynomial setting with monomial shifts allowed.
- Token 6611 [questionable statement]: Assumes any product of distinct `Phi_{2e}` factors can be realized in one `x^D+1`, ignoring compatibility constraints.
- Token 11216 [mistake]: Reports an incorrect interim total of 74 based on that unrestricted factor-combination model.
- Token 11754-16953 [wasted]: Spends a long segment generating/enumerating candidates under the over-permissive 74-model before fixing the structural condition.
- Token 17465 [breakthrough]: Derives the necessary same-`v2(e)` condition (`D/e` odd for all factors), correcting the core overcounting issue.
- Token 19811 [verification]: Cross-checks constrained vs unconstrained candidate sets and confirms the corrected set size is 58.
- Token 25881 [verification]: Constructs factor-based witnesses and confirms all 58 generated alphas satisfy the shifty condition.
- Token 28499 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{58}`.
