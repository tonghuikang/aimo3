## Answer: correct (58)

## Key moments
- Token 1711 [insight]: Recognizes the task as convolution divisibility (`alpha * gamma = e_k + e_l`), moving from raw sums to algebraic structure.
- Token 1976 [breakthrough]: Converts to Laurent-polynomial multiplication `A(x)G(x)=x^k+x^l`, enabling factor-based counting.
- Token 4927 [questionable statement]: Drifts toward “many/infinite possible low-degree divisors” without enforcing a single shared `d` compatibility condition.
- Token 5382 [mistake]: States that any product of even-index cyclotomics can divide some `x^N+1`; this ignores incompatibility across different 2-adic classes.
- Token 6560 [breakthrough]: Correctly imposes the same-`v2(k)` requirement for combined `Phi_{2k}` factors, fixing the divisor classification.
- Token 11924 [insight]: Enumerates admissible low-degree `Q` families and degree filters (`<=5`) to get the finite candidate set.
- Token 13137 [verification]: Computes degree-by-degree shift counts and gets total 58.
- Token 16410-17012 [wasted]: Performs extra symbolic factorization/listing after the count is already established, adding length without changing conclusions.
- Token 18181 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{58}`.
