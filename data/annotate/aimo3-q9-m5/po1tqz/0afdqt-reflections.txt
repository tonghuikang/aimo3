## Answer: correct (58)

## Key moments
- Token 2695 [insight]: Tests single-support `alpha` and notices only coefficient `±1` works, surfacing the divisibility/content constraint early.
- Token 4219 [breakthrough]: Recasts the correlation condition as Laurent-polynomial multiplication `A(x)B(x)=x^k+x^l`, turning the task into a factorization/counting problem.
- Token 12130 [questionable statement]: Starts counting with a `v2=0` cyclotomic group (`Phi_1, Phi_3, Phi_5`) as if it could appear in `1+x^d` divisors.
- Token 12741 [mistake]: Explicitly works through why odd-index cyclotomic factors cannot divide `1+x^d`; this invalidates the earlier `v2=0` candidate group.
- Token 16170 [breakthrough]: Establishes the correct canonical form `alpha=x^c * eps * Q` with `Q` built from one fixed `v2` family, which makes counting finite and structured.
- Token 16691-16810 [wasted]: Performs an overcount/subtraction path caused by counting the empty product in multiple groups instead of using a single canonical set from the start.
- Token 20496 [missed opportunity]: Reopens already-settled doubts about possible large coefficients/non-cyclotomic divisors instead of directly finalizing from the established factorization argument.
- Token 24805 [verification]: Runs Python-based enumeration/factor checks and confirms the counted set size is exactly 58.
- Token 30201 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{58}`.
