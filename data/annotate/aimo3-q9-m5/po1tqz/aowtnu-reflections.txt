## Answer: correct (58)

## Key moments
- Token 877 [insight]: Reframes the shift-dot-product condition as a convolution equation with a reversed sequence.
- Token 1717 [breakthrough]: Moves to Laurent-polynomial form `A(x)B(x)=x^k+x^l`, enabling algebraic divisor reasoning.
- Token 3375 [breakthrough]: Correctly keeps divisibility in `Z[x,x^{-1}]`, which preserves valid monomial-shifted `A(x)=x^sQ(x)` candidates.
- Token 3522 [missed opportunity]: Resets into speculative counting and ad hoc examples instead of directly executing the established factor-structure count.
- Token 7094-16000 [wasted]: Large manual, repetitive factor-by-factor exploration before converging on a clean finite family enumeration.
- Token 16762 [insight]: Enumerates the low-degree cyclotomic building blocks and shift ranges that fit support `[0,5]`.
- Token 20954 [insight]: Switches to programmatic candidate generation/counting to avoid additional manual omission risk.
- Token 27086 [verification]: Implements explicit shifty-detection checks and confirms exactly 58 solutions (including the `[-2,2]` coefficient range test).
- Token 27559 [final answer]: Commits to the 58 conclusion (`\boxed{58}` intent).
