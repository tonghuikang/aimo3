Correct answer: 58

Correct approach:
- Encode \(\alpha\) as a polynomial
  \(A(x)=\sum_{i=0}^5 a_i x^i\), where \(a_i=\alpha(i)\).
- Rewrite
  \(S_n(\alpha)\star\beta\) as coefficient extraction from a Laurent-product, so the condition is equivalent to
  \(A(x)B(x)=x^k+x^l=x^k(1+x^D)\), \(D=|l-k|>0\), with \(B\in\mathbb Z[x,x^{-1}]\).
- Therefore \(A\) must be of form
  \(A(x)=\pm x^t P(x)\), where \(P(0)\neq0\) and \(P\mid (1+x^D)\) in \(\mathbb Z[x]\).
- Irreducible factors of \(1+x^D\) are cyclotomic \(\Phi_{2e}(x)\) with \(e\mid D\) and \(D/e\) odd. For a product \(P=\prod \Phi_{2e_i}\), all \(e_i\) must have the same 2-adic valuation (same \(v_2(e_i)\)).
- Degree \(\le 5\) allows only:
  - \(\Phi_2\) (deg 1), \(\Phi_6\) (deg 2), \(\Phi_{10}\) (deg 4)
  - \(\Phi_4\) (deg 2), \(\Phi_{12}\) (deg 4)
  - \(\Phi_8\) (deg 4)
- Count by compatible groups plus shifts/sign:
  - Empty product (monomials): \(2\times(6-0)=12\)
  - Group \(\{\Phi_2,\Phi_6,\Phi_{10}\}\): allowed nonempty subsets with degree \(\le5\) contribute
    \(2\times[(6-1)+(6-2)+(6-4)+(6-3)+(6-5)] = 30\)
  - Group \(\{\Phi_4,\Phi_{12}\}\): \(2\times[(6-2)+(6-4)] = 12\)
  - Group \(\{\Phi_8\}\): \(2\times(6-4)=4\)
  - Total: \(12+30+12+4=58\).

Wrong approach 1 (gives 18):
- Force \(A\) itself to divide \(1+x^D\) in \(\mathbb Z[x]\), effectively imposing \(a_0=\pm1\) and excluding \(A=\pm x^tP\) with \(t>0\).
- This keeps only 9 unshifted monic cores (and their negatives), yielding \(2\times9=18\), which undercounts by missing shifted placements.

Wrong approach 2 (gives 28):
- Enumerate low-degree even-index cyclotomic subsets as if they can always coexist in one \(x^D+1\), but still ignore shift multiplicity.
- This incorrectly allows incompatible mixes (e.g., factors requiring different 2-adic classes), producing 28.

Wrong approach 3 (gives 74):
- Combine both errors in opposite directions: allow incompatible cyclotomic mixes and also count shifts/signs.
- This overcounts to 74 because compatibility condition \(D/e_i\) odd for all selected factors is violated.
