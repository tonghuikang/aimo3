Problem: IMO 2025 P6 Simplified 9
Correct Answer: 12

Problem Summary:
- We choose 9 uncovered cells on a 9x9 grid, with exactly one uncovered cell in each row and each column.
- So uncovered cells form a permutation pattern.
- The other 72 cells must be partitioned into non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles.

Correct Approach:
- Model rows and columns as the two sides of a bipartite graph; uncovered cells are a perfect matching M.
- Covered cells correspond to edges of K_{n,n} \ M, and each tile is a biclique block in an edge partition (not just an edge cover).
- The exact minimum for this problem family is
  n + ceil(log2 n) - 1.
- For n = 9:
  9 + ceil(log2 9) - 1 = 9 + 4 - 1 = 12.
- An explicit construction achieves 12, and the matching lower bound is given by the same biclique-partition theory.

Wrong Approaches:
- Wrong 16 via diagonal-only reasoning:
  - Assume holes are on the main diagonal and separately tile strict upper/lower triangles.
  - This gives 2(n-1) = 16, but it is only for that restricted layout and is not globally optimal over all permutations.
- Wrong 16 via forced left/right strip decomposition:
  - Argue each side always needs 8 strips (8+8).
  - This overconstrains rectangle structure and misses better multi-row/multi-column packings available for other permutations.
- Wrong 5 via overlap-allowed biclique cover:
  - Solve the easier edge-cover version (rectangles may overlap), then claim 5.
  - Invalid because the task requires a disjoint rectangle partition (each cell covered by at most one tile).
