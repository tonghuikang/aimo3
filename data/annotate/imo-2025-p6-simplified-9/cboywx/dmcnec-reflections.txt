## Answer: wrong (16)

## Key moments
- Token 6 [insight]: Correctly identifies that the uncovered cells must form a permutation (one hole per row and column).
- Token 3153 [verification]: Empirical small-\(n\) search reports values like \(n=4\to5\), signaling that non-diagonal permutations can materially change counts.
- Token 4361-11378 [wasted]: Long detour into biclique-cover/antichain reasoning for edge coverage, which does not by itself enforce non-overlapping tile partitions.
- Token 11917 [questionable statement]: Treats cut-style rectangle covers as if they directly produce valid tilings under the no-overlap constraint.
- Token 12528 [mistake]: Concludes the minimum is 5 from the covering model.
- Token 13967 [insight]: Area check (96 vs required 72) exposes overlap in the 5-rectangle construction.
- Token 14199 [breakthrough]: Correctly reframes the task as exact partition (disjoint rectangles), not just covering.
- Token 16988 [questionable statement]: Narrows analysis to the diagonal upper/lower-triangle decomposition as though it were representative of the global optimum over all permutations.
- Token 19416 [missed opportunity]: Recalls earlier non-diagonal computational evidence but does not reconcile it with the diagonal-only argument.
- Token 22111 [questionable statement]: Reinterprets earlier better results as an overlap artifact instead of testing whether they were valid non-diagonal partitions.
- Token 22559 [mistake]: Infers a universal \(2(n-1)\) minimum from the diagonal staircase analysis.
- Token 23196 [missed opportunity]: Commits to \(2n-2\) without rerunning a full exact-partition search over permutations at \(n=9\).
- Token 24819 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{16}\), which is incorrect.
