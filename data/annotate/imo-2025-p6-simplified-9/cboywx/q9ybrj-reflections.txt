## Answer: wrong (16)

## Key moments
- Token 214 [insight]: Correctly frames the optimization over all permutations of uncovered cells, not a fixed layout.
- Token 2051 [breakthrough]: Derives the key structural split that any rectangle must lie entirely on one side of each row’s hole.
- Token 4425-11053 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch implementing and debugging code for a special staircase case without resolving the global minimum over permutations.
- Token 11131 [questionable statement]: Infers from one computed staircase instance that identity-like behavior should enforce a 16-tile global lower bound.
- Token 11230 [mistake]: Asserts a universal lower bound of 16 from that restricted computation.
- Token 11537 [insight]: Correctly observes left lengths are a permutation of 0..8, a strong invariant that could support a tighter argument.
- Token 12508 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly notes other permutations might beat 16 and proposes full search, but never completes that decisive check.
- Token 14658 [missed opportunity]: Starts setting up a full per-permutation rectangle solver but does not finish the decisive computation before locking in 16.
- Token 17811 [questionable statement]: Claims each nonempty left column must force a distinct rightmost-column rectangle in a way treated as universally binding.
- Token 18502 [mistake]: Concludes left side is always at least 8 tiles and therefore total is always 16, which overconstrains possible tilings.
- Token 19096 [missed opportunity]: Final lower-bound writeup is not stress-tested against counter-tilings that use fewer than 8+8.
- Token 19284 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{16}\), which is incorrect.
