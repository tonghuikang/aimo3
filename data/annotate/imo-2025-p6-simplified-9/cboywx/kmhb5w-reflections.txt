## Answer: correct (12)

## Key moments
- Token 499 [insight]: Correctly frames the task as optimizing over permutations of holes plus a rectangle partition of the remaining cells.
- Token 2615-4253 [wasted]: Long stretch of speculative formula hunting without committing to a decisive computation.
- Token 4490 [insight]: Moves to the right computational framing (exact cover / partition by rectangles for a fixed permutation).
- Token 9367 [missed opportunity]: Continues abstract discussion instead of immediately executing the planned solver workflow.
- Token 11627 [verification]: Starts implementing and running solver experiments on smaller \(n\), giving concrete calibration data.
- Token 14979 [questionable statement]: Introduces a conjectural formula that predicts \(13\) for \(n=9\).
- Token 18972 [questionable statement]: Begins preparing a proof for that conjecture before it is reliably validated.
- Token 20007 [mistake]: States the suspected general answer as 13 for this instance.
- Token 20626 [verification]: Re-runs the solver with longer limits on candidate permutations to check the 13-claim.
- Token 22079 [insight]: Updates the working hypothesis to 12 after stronger computational evidence.
- Token 25239 [verification]: Cross-checks additional \(n\)-patterns and formula variants to stress-test whether 12 is plausible.
- Token 27605 [insight]: Converges on 12 as the consistent target for the \(n=9\) case.
- Token 30512-32265 [breakthrough]: Extracts an explicit 12-rectangle construction from solver output, giving a concrete attainment.
- Token 33151 [missed opportunity]: Still lacks a clean first-principles lower-bound proof and cycles through uncertain formula templates.
- Token 35949 [verification]: Aligns a known lower-bound claim with the 12-tile construction, closing the gap between bound and example.
- Token 36339 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{12}\), which is correct.
