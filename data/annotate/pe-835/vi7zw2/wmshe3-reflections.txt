## Answer: correct (1050923942)

## Key moments
- Token 101 [insight]: Frames the task as complete classification of Pythagorean triples with any consecutive-side pair.
- Token 749 [breakthrough]: Converts the consecutive-legs condition to the negative Pell equation `x^2 - 2m^2 = -1`, giving a structured infinite family.
- Token 3107 [insight]: Parameterizes leg-hypotenuse-consecutive triples with odd `m` and prepares perimeter extraction.
- Token 3191 [breakthrough]: Reduces Family B perimeter to `p_B(m)=m(m+1)`, enabling direct summation.
- Token 3653 [questionable statement]: Starts claiming possible disjointness of Family A and Family B without a full overlap proof.
- Token 3829 [mistake]: Concludes the families are disjoint, which is false because `(3,4,5)` belongs to both.
- Token 4256-4862 [wasted]: Spends a long derivation on counting/summing odd-index terms before resolving the overlap issue that changes the final combination rule.
- Token 14008 [insight]: Switches to state-vector recurrence summation (`[p_k, p_{k-1}, S_k]`) for efficient large-index Pell aggregation.
- Token 14337 [breakthrough]: Finalizes the 3x3 matrix transition, enabling `O(log K)` modular computation of Family A sums.
- Token 16807 [questionable statement]: States final combination as `S_A + S_B` (no overlap correction), carrying the earlier disjointness assumption forward.
- Token 18224 [verification]: Runs small-`N` checks and family-based comparisons, which helps expose consistency issues with the no-overlap assumption.
- Token 19022 [mistake]: Produces intermediate total `1050923954`, which is off by 12 due to double-counting `(3,4,5)`.
- Token 20579 [insight]: Re-examines overlap and explicitly recognizes `(3,4,5)` satisfies both family definitions.
- Token 21904 [breakthrough]: Corrects the union formula to subtract one duplicate perimeter (`-12`).
- Token 22111 [verification]: Confirms corrected formula matches `S(100)=258` after subtracting the overlap.
- Token 22342 [final answer]: Commits to corrected final result `1050923942`.
