# PE 700 - Eulercoins

## Problem
Find the sum of all Eulercoins for
`a_n = (1504170715041707 * n) mod 4503599627370517`,
where an Eulercoin is a new strict prefix minimum.

## Correct Answer
1517926517777556

## Correct Approach
- Let `A = 1504170715041707`, `M = 4503599627370517`.
- Eulercoins are record minima of `A*n mod M`, i.e., values where `A*n` is just above a multiple of `M`.
- This is a best-approximation problem: record minima come from continued-fraction best lower approximants, not just principal convergents.
- Compute the continued fraction (equivalently via Euclidean algorithm) and generate both:
  - convergents
  - semiconvergents/intermediate fractions
- For each candidate denominator/index `n`, compute `r = (A*n) mod M`; keep strictly decreasing `r` values and sum them.
- Important: principal convergents alone are incomplete; semiconvergents are required to recover all Eulercoins.
- Resulting set has 101 positive Eulercoins (plus final 0), and the total is `1517926517777556`.

## Wrong Approaches And Why They Fail
- **Memorized-answer shortcut**: returning `15179265177775562` (17 digits) without derivation is wrong.
- **Convergents-only method**: misses semiconvergent coins, so it undercounts and gives too-small totals (e.g., around `1515851620076201`).
- **Naive inverse-index greedy rule** (`idx(v) > max idx(w>v)`) as a sufficient condition: necessary but not sufficient, so it can admit non-coins / wrong completeness logic and produce near-miss sums such as `1517926539241925`.
- **Raw Euclidean-remainder subset as full coin list**: remainders/convergents provide structure, but selecting only a subset of them is not enough for full correctness.
