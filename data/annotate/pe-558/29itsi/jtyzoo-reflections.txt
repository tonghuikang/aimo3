## Answer: correct (75292)

## Key moments
- Token 223 [insight]: Sets the target correctly as counting 1-digits in the unique constrained representation.
- Token 5056 [verification]: Early greedy walk-through on small examples matches the stated representation behavior.
- Token 10775-18155 [wasted]: Extended numeration-theory and algebraic-structure exploration before converging on a stable implementation strategy.
- Token 20038 [insight]: Recognizes that negative exponent depth is a practical risk and may need a conservative lower bound.
- Token 25732 [questionable statement]: Suggests float-based sign decisions are probably safe with tolerance despite known near-boundary sensitivity.
- Token 30523 [questionable statement]: Interprets failures as evidence that greedy itself may be invalid for this representation.
- Token 31338 [mistake]: Wrongly concludes greedy is failing; the issue is implementation details (precision/cutoff), not the method.
- Token 32019-53077 [wasted]: Large detour into alternative formulations and brute-force checks triggered by the incorrect greedy diagnosis.
- Token 38117 [verification]: Uses search-style checks to confirm valid representations exist for problematic cases, helping isolate implementation error.
- Token 44821 [insight]: Identifies float rounding as a source of extra-term artifacts.
- Token 50363 [breakthrough]: Pinpoints the concrete bug in the Decimal path (strict comparison without epsilon handling).
- Token 59321 [breakthrough]: Corrected epsilon-based Decimal greedy produces stable behavior on tested cases.
- Token 60727 [questionable statement]: Assumes exponent bound E=100 should be enough for larger inputs.
- Token 61952 [mistake]: E=100 fails on larger test cases, proving the bound assumption wrong.
- Token 62430 [breakthrough]: Derives and adopts a safer lower-bound choice (E≈250) for full-range computation.
- Token 66508 [breakthrough]: Implements the final optimized `compute_S_mod` full-run routine.
- Token 67145 [verification]: Confirms the final pipeline still matches S(10)=61 and S(1000)=19403.
- Token 67629 [verification]: Re-runs at E=300 to check cutoff robustness; result remains unchanged.
- Token 67759 [final answer]: Commits to \boxed{75292}.
