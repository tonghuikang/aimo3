## Answer: correct (75292)

## Key moments
- Token 111 [insight]: Establishes that w(n) is the count of selected powers in the constrained spacing-3 representation.
- Token 2855 [breakthrough]: Moves to a greedy subtraction strategy with explicit spacing enforcement as the core computation model.
- Token 7396-12468 [wasted]: Long theoretical detour (beta-expansion/recurrence analogies) before committing to an executable solver design.
- Token 14994 [insight]: Diagnoses rounding-tail failures and recognizes that stronger arithmetic control is required.
- Token 19075 [breakthrough]: Implements a high-precision Decimal power table and a working exact-style weight computation.
- Token 19518 [verification]: Validates the approach on S(10)=61.
- Token 19706 [verification]: Validates again on S(1000)=19403.
- Token 22002-23332 [wasted]: Spends substantial effort on alternative sign-testing and bounding machinery after already having a usable decimal method.
- Token 28923 [breakthrough]: Returns to the simple greedy rule as the reliable computational backbone.
- Token 37246 [insight]: Analyzes negative-exponent depth and motivates using a conservative lower exponent bound.
- Token 46514 [breakthrough]: Simplifies to Decimal-only residual updates with precomputed powers, producing a major speed improvement.
- Token 47106 [verification]: Benchmarks confirm the optimized routine is fast enough for the full target range.
- Token 47508 [verification]: Re-checks the known reference values in the final implementation path.
- Token 47587 [verification]: Runs the full S(5,000,000) computation and obtains 226,754,889.
- Token 47746 [final answer]: Computes modulo 99991 and commits to 75292.
