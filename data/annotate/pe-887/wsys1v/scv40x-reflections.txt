## Answer: correct (92296)

## Key moments
- Token 1162 [insight]: Recasts the problem as a decision-tree depth assignment with constraints `depth(x) <= x + d` and objective of minimizing worst-case depth.
- Token 1572 [questionable statement]: Switches to a pure prefix-code/Kraft framing, which is useful but risks losing ordered-threshold search semantics if applied carelessly.
- Token 2458-3680 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch in repetitive weight/geometric-sum algebra before consolidating the capacity expression.
- Token 3312 [insight]: Splits the weighted-capacity sum into the `N <= K` and `N > K` regimes, which enables a closed-form bound.
- Token 4135 [breakthrough]: Derives the main capacity form for `M > d`: `capacity(M) = K + 1 + 2^K(2^d - 1)` with `K = M - d`.
- Token 4902 [questionable statement]: Promotes `Q(N,d) = d + K(N,d)` as a universal inversion, implicitly assuming the `M > d` regime always applies.
- Token 5501 [missed opportunity]: Moves into interval summation without a fast sanity check on the `N=1` base case.
- Token 5565 [mistake]: Detects a contradiction (`Q(1,d)=d` from the formula) against the required zero-question case for `N=1`.
- Token 6045 [insight]: Identifies the root cause: the model omitted the depth-0/root-leaf possibility.
- Token 7150 [breakthrough]: Fixes the model with piecewise capacity (`M <= d: 2^M`, `M > d: K + 1 + 2^K(2^d - 1)`), restoring `Q(1,d)=0`.
- Token 10803 [verification]: Re-validates the corrected model against anchors `Q(7,1)=3` and `Q(777,2)=10`.
- Token 14913 [verification]: Confirms interval-based summation against direct brute-force totals on small `Nmax` values.
- Token 15173 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{92296}`.
