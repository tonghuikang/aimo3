## Answer: correct (92296)

## Key moments
- Token 3749 [insight]: Reframes the task using a capacity function `M(H,d)` and the inversion `Q(N,d)=min{H : M(H,d) >= N}`, which sets up the right global approach.
- Token 9056 [questionable statement]: Implements the right-subtree recurrence with offset `left + d` (missing the `-1` after consuming the root question).
- Token 13980 [missed opportunity]: Starts validating sample values but does not immediately enforce the given invariant `Q(N,0)=N-1`, delaying detection of the recurrence bug.
- Token 14548 [mistake]: Finds the contradiction `Q(5,0)=3` against the stated `Q(N,0)=N-1`, confirming the prior recurrence mapping is wrong.
- Token 17289 [insight]: Manual simulation for `N=5,d=0` pinpoints that the right branch for `x=2` exceeds allowed depth, revealing the index-shift accounting error.
- Token 17905 [breakthrough]: Correctly derives right-subtree offset as `L + d - 1`, fixing the off-by-one transformation after one question is spent.
- Token 18699 [questionable statement]: Uses the corrected split recurrence but still assumes an internal-root expansion only, omitting the legal one-leaf tree under a height cap.
- Token 19673 [mistake]: Gets impossible values (e.g., `M(2,0)=0`), exposing that the recurrence is still incomplete.
- Token 20476 [insight]: Recognizes the failure mode comes from forbidding the “no split” case when height bound is `<= H` rather than exactly `H`.
- Token 21021 [breakthrough]: Adds baseline `max(1, left+right)` (leaf-only option), repairing negative-offset edge cases and restoring consistency.
- Token 25369 [verification]: Checks the required benchmark `Q(777,2)=10`, confirming the repaired DP aligns with the problem’s given value.
- Token 26768-27560 [wasted]: Spends extra cycles re-proving left-size optimality and saturation properties after core totals and benchmark checks are already consistent.
- Token 29110 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{92296}`.
