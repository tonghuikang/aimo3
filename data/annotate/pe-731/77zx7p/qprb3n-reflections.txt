## Answer: wrong (96329)

## Key moments
- Token 2079 [insight]: Correctly identifies the extraction form \(D=\lfloor 10^{n+9}A\rfloor \bmod 10^{10}\) for the 10-digit block.
- Token 2632 [questionable statement]: Suggests computing the result modulo \(99991\) directly, which risks dropping the required intermediate \(\bmod 10^{10}\) step.
- Token 4338 [breakthrough]: Reduces to a finite sum with \(K=33\) and common denominator \(3^{33}\), giving a computable rational representation.
- Token 4650-4938 [wasted]: Manually lists many powers of 3 instead of using direct exponent checks/computation.
- Token 5217 [questionable statement]: Reframes the target as \(N//3^{33} \bmod 99991\), again drifting from \((\lfloor 10^{n+9}A\rfloor \bmod 10^{10})\bmod 99991\).
- Token 7118 [mistake]: Uses a formula for \(D\bmod p\) based on \(q=\lfloor 10^{n+9}A\rfloor\) modulo \(p\), not the required 10-digit block modulo \(10^{10}\).
- Token 7329 [mistake]: Final computation pipeline preserves the same target error by never reducing \(q\) modulo \(10^{10}\) before reducing modulo \(99991\).
- Token 8350 [missed opportunity]: Mentions checking against the provided examples but does not perform that check, which would have exposed the mismatch.
- Token 8784 [final answer]: Commits to the computed wrong remainder \(96329\).
