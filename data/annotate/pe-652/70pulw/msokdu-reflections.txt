## Answer: correct (983924497)

## Key moments
- Token 1324 [insight]: Identifies that classes can be understood through rational logs (same core) versus irrational logs (different cores).
- Token 5550 [insight]: Locks in the rational-value count formula `R(L)=2*Σφ(k)-1` for reduced fractions up to `L=floor(log2 N)`.
- Token 10224 [questionable statement]: Assumes `D(N)=R(L)+P(N)` with `P(N)` as only “different-core pairs,” dropping exponent-ratio multiplicity for irrational families.
- Token 12049 [missed opportunity]: Starts a long `Q(N)`/perfect-power algebra expansion before rechecking whether the simplified class model is valid.
- Token 12049-16923 [wasted]: Extensive derivation on the simplified model that is later abandoned.
- Token 13755 [mistake]: Commits to the oversimplified `D(N)=R(L)+P(N)` path, which undercounts irrational-class diversity.
- Token 15281 [missed opportunity]: Continues rewriting `D=(N-1)^2+R-S1+S2` under the same flawed premise instead of pivoting sooner.
- Token 23928 [insight]: Returns to the correct grouped formulation using `C_e` buckets and `R(e1,e2)` contributions.
- Token 32350 [breakthrough]: Explicitly restores per-core-pair exponent-ratio counting, resolving the earlier undercount.
- Token 32777 [verification]: Brute-force canonical-class checks for small `N` align with `compute_D_general`.
- Token 33745 [verification]: Additional `N=100` brute comparison matches exactly.
- Token 34733 [verification]: Reconfirms against the provided `D(10000)` checkpoint.
- Token 35140 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{983924497}`.
