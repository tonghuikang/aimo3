## Answer: correct (794394453)

## Key moments
- Token 96 [insight]: Correctly frames the CRT decomposition: compute per-prime-power orders and take an LCM.
- Token 431 [questionable statement]: Floats the idea that the answer may effectively be `λ(n!)`, despite this usually being only an upper bound.
- Token 431-2705 [wasted]: Extended probabilistic/heuristic discussion about primitive-root behavior and Carmichael bounds before settling on an executable exact method.
- Token 839 [questionable statement]: Uses a shaky primitive-root probability argument to justify a near-`λ(n!)` expectation.
- Token 1200 [missed opportunity]: Delays direct construction of an exact prime-exponent LCM algorithm, despite already having the right decomposition lens.
- Token 5303 [breakthrough]: Lands on the correct lift formula shape `ord_{q^e}(p) = d_q * q^{max(0, e-v_q)}` with `v_q = v_q(p^{d_q}-1)`.
- Token 10002 [insight]: Recasts each prime contribution explicitly (`d_q`, `v_q`, `e_q`, and the resulting prime-power term), setting up a computable pipeline.
- Token 15413 [questionable statement]: Reverts to an `e_q-1` baseline shortcut and ad-hoc correction logic, which is not stable when `v_q>1`.
- Token 18326 [mistake]: Misreads the `n=12` discrepancy (`51840` vs `17280`) and starts correcting from an inconsistent baseline.
- Token 20555 [questionable statement]: Asserts that `base_product` must divide the final LCM, overlooking that true exponents are `e_q-v_q`, not always `e_q-1`.
- Token 20891 [mistake]: Only partially fixes the overcount (dividing by `q^{v_q-1}`) but still lacks a fully consistent global exponent-max treatment.
- Token 18326-22428 [wasted]: Long algebraic loop around `base_product`, `D`, and correction factors before returning to direct prime-exponent maximization.
- Token 21906 [mistake]: Formula still yields `69120` on `n=12`, confirming unresolved double-counting/overlap issues.
- Token 23745 [insight]: Switches to the correct global view: maintain a prime `exponent_map` as maxima over all term factorizations.
- Token 23841 [breakthrough]: Final algorithmic formulation is correct: update each prime exponent from `q`-power part and factorization of `d_q`, then multiply prime powers mod `p`.
- Token 31237 [verification]: Implements `compute_R` with SPF/order/lift logic and validates on small cases including the official `n=12` check.
- Token 32831 [verification]: Runs full-scale `n=10^7` computation successfully and repeats it for consistency.
- Token 33135 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{794394453}`.
