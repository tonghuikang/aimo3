## Answer: correct (794394453)

## Key moments
- Token 93 [insight]: Starts with the correct CRT decomposition idea: reduce the global order modulo `n!` to orders modulo prime powers.
- Token 980 [breakthrough]: States the lifting formula for odd primes (`ord_{q^e}(p)` from `ord_q(p)` and `v_q(p^{ord_q(p)}-1)`), which becomes the core computational scaffold.
- Token 2041-4341 [wasted]: Long Carmichael-function detour (`R ≈ λ(n!)`) that consumes substantial reasoning before being invalidated.
- Token 3830 [questionable statement]: Treats `R` as likely equal to `λ(n!)` under heuristic assumptions about primitive roots and lifting.
- Token 4680 [mistake]: Empirical check (`λ(12!) = 103680` vs expected `17280`) disproves the λ-equality assumption.
- Token 10468 [questionable statement]: Introduces a product-style closed form with `∏ d_q` and denominator adjustments, but this conflates LCM behavior with multiplicative aggregation.
- Token 18623 [mistake]: Commits to the incorrect formula `L = n! * (∏ d_q) / (2^3 * ∏ q^{t_q})`, which overcounts shared prime factors across terms.
- Token 25879 [missed opportunity]: Initially narrows exceptional `t_q>1` handling to too small a set, delaying a full scan for additional Wieferich-like primes.
- Token 28412 [mistake]: Produces wrong candidate `631550145`, exposing that the current decomposition is still structurally wrong.
- Token 29828 [insight]: Identifies the core structural bug: `lcm(d_q)` and primewise maxima are required; raw products are invalid for overlapping factors.
- Token 29895 [questionable statement]: Transitional formula still partially over-aggregates components before the full prime-exponent max formulation is completed.
- Token 33007-36788 [wasted]: Repeated algebraic patching around the `n=12` mismatch (`69120` vs `17280`) before switching cleanly to per-prime exponent maxima.
- Token 33519 [mistake]: Confirms the overshoot-by-4 failure on the validation case (`69120`), proving the intermediate formula is still wrong.
- Token 38064 [breakthrough]: Final correct strategy: compute `max` exponent per prime across all terms (`e_q - t_q` vs factor exponents from `d_q`), including special handling for prime `2`.
- Token 41705 [verification]: Implementation check on `n=12` returns `17280`, matching the problem statement example.
- Token 45594 [missed opportunity]: Finds a validation pitfall: reusing global `max_exp` for smaller `n` distorts checks; local recomputation is needed for those tests.
- Token 49090 [verification]: Naive-vs-fast comparisons across small `n` values all match after fixes, increasing confidence in the large-`n` run.
- Token 49342 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{794394453}` after the corrected algorithm and validations.
