## Answer: correct (381868244)

## Key moments
- Token 5118 [insight]: Flags a core inconsistency between a naive coding lower bound and the provided sample `h(2,3,3)=4`, forcing a re-model.
- Token 7249 [breakthrough]: Establishes the correct state transition for full-plate queries (`YES -> (size,0,0)`, `NO -> plate eliminated`), enabling valid DP.
- Token 13422 [verification]: Implements corrected DP and matches given checkpoints (`h(1,2,3)=3`, `h(2,3,3)=4`).
- Token 20629 [insight]: Isolates the target as classifying when `h` exceeds `ceil(log2 T)`.
- Token 22412 [breakthrough]: Identifies power-of-two totals as structurally hardest because they require exact half-splits.
- Token 22580 [verification]: Confirms recursive propagation with `(2,3,11) -> (2,3,3)`, showing root half-splitting alone is insufficient.
- Token 31917 [breakthrough]: Observes YES branches are always one-plate states (`f=yes=0`), so only NO-branch hardness needs counting.
- Token 37421 [insight]: Reframes extra states as recursively reducible constructions from smaller hard cores.
- Token 44185 [questionable statement]: Introduces an over-simple aggregate recurrence `f(T)=A(T)+3f(T-half)` without a full propagation condition.
- Token 51572 [verification]: Corrects one counting component (`A(T)` bound uses `L-1`, not `half-1`) but recurrence is still not fully correct.
- Token 54705 [mistake]: Recurrence predicts `f(24)=9` while brute-force gives `0`, proving missing conditions in propagation.
- Token 54705-64206 [wasted]: Long contradiction-resolution loop around `L`, `half`, and interval indexing before the correct condition is pinned down.
- Token 64289 [breakthrough]: Derives the corrected recurrence with the `L > half/2` gating, resolving the `T=24` failure.
- Token 67122 [verification]: Validates the corrected `f(t)` recurrence numerically on small ranges.
- Token 70457 [breakthrough]: Lifts pointwise recurrence to block-prefix recursion `S(N)` for fast summation.
- Token 79514 [verification]: Confirms recursive `S(N)` against brute-force prefix sums.
- Token 80416 [verification]: Confirms final assembly against all known values (`H(6)=203`, `H(20)=7718`, `H(111)=1634144`).
- Token 80553 [verification]: Computes `H(R_19)` with the validated fast pipeline.
- Token 80854 [final answer]: Commits to boxed `381868244`.
