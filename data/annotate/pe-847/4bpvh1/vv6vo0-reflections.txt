## Answer: wrong (no final answer)

## Key moments
- Token 1298 [questionable statement]: Models the YES branch as reducing one plate to `s` while keeping other plates unchanged.
- Token 1804 [mistake]: Builds the main DP recurrence on that incorrect transition (`YES -> (s,b,c)`), so early derivations optimize the wrong state graph.
- Token 6843 [insight]: Explicitly notices the branch-semantics bug and states that YES should eliminate all other plates.
- Token 7127 [breakthrough]: Corrects the recurrence to `YES -> (s,0,0)` and `NO -> (n-s,...)`, which is the right structural model.
- Token 13284 [verification]: Reconfirms the one-plate base case `h(n,0,0)=ceil(log2 n)` after recurrence repair.
- Token 23076 [insight]: Uses brute-force tables to isolate that `h` appears to be `ceil(log2 T)` or `ceil(log2 T)+1`.
- Token 32271 [questionable statement]: Treats whole-plate tests mainly as weak because worst-case follows the larger side, underestimating their strategic role in plate elimination timing.
- Token 40283 [missed opportunity]: Explores final-step configuration logic but does not convert it into a stable criterion for `delta`.
- Token 49576 [insight]: Reframes the objective as counting constrained decision-tree capacity rather than only local split quality.
- Token 53130 [verification]: Uses `(2,2,4)` as a concrete counterexample to simplistic power-of-two heuristics.
- Token 59700 [questionable statement]: Returns to a split-minimization surrogate that still does not fully encode adaptive branch structure.
- Token 67342 [breakthrough]: Cleanly decomposes `H(N)=A(N)+B(N)` with `A` easy and `B` determined by `D_T` counting.
- Token 76611 [mistake]: Proposes a broad offset-region characterization for `D_T` that is later shown inconsistent.
- Token 80053 [verification]: Recomputes `D_T(27)` and surfaces internal contradictions in the current classification.
- Token 80932 [questionable statement]: Suggests an unproven bounded-offset box as a general rule for all interval regimes.
- Token 81761 [mistake]: Commits to that box-constraint formula for `D_T` without validating high-`S` behavior.
- Token 84090 [verification]: Brute-force checks at `T=32` falsify the proposed closed form.
- Token 89868 [insight]: Finds a valid partial regularity (quadratic fit in early-half `S` range) but not a full-interval law.
- Token 92533-103606 [wasted]: Long sequence of speculative inequalities, partial fits, and restart loops that never stabilizes into a correct global formula.
- Token 97018 [missed opportunity]: Switches to repeated inability statements instead of pivoting to a bounded, test-driven derivation from known checkpoints.
- Token 104707 [final answer]: Ends with the repeated “I’m sorry, but I don’t have a solution for this problem.” response instead of an integer.
