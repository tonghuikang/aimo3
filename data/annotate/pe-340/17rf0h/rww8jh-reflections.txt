## Answer: correct (291504964)

## Key moments
- Token 5960 [insight]: Detects a blockwise pattern in the sample (`diff(n) = 40 + 80*floor((B-n)/50)`), which motivates a general block-index formula.
- Token 6578 [questionable statement]: Proposes the overgeneralized rule `F(n) = n + c + 2c*floor((b-n)/a)` from limited evidence.
- Token 6625 [mistake]: Randomized checking contradicts that rule, showing the guessed `2c` slope is not generally valid.
- Token 7664-14082 [wasted]: Long trial-and-error phase over candidate formulas for `L` (ratios/linear combinations) before locking onto a structural derivation.
- Token 8170 [missed opportunity]: Continues ad-hoc coefficient guessing instead of switching earlier to a direct recurrence/block proof.
- Token 14082 [insight]: Identifies the promising relation `L = A + 3(A-C)` from cross-case consistency.
- Token 14173 [breakthrough]: Finalizes constants `D = 4(A-C)` and `L = 4A-3C`, yielding the usable closed form for `F(n)` by block index.
- Token 18032 [verification]: Runs 100 random parameter tests and confirms the derived closed form against brute-force recursion.
- Token 18384 [verification]: Verifies the summed formula for `S` on multiple small cases against brute-force totals.
- Token 19079-19337 [wasted]: Rehashes confidence concerns about huge-`b` simulation without adding new derivation or checks beyond already completed validations.
- Token 19766 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{291504964}`.
