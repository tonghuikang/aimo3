## Answer: correct (291504964)

## Key moments
- Token 12481 [insight]: Extracts a clean blockwise pattern from the worked example (`F(n)=n+K-2c\lceil n/a\rceil` form), giving an initial structural hypothesis.
- Token 13725 [questionable statement]: Generalizes that sample-specific rule to all parameters as `F(n)=n+c+2c\lfloor (b-n)/a\rfloor` without proof.
- Token 14772 [missed opportunity]: Continues broad case-by-case pattern hunting instead of switching immediately to a recurrence-level derivation.
- Token 15049 [mistake]: Counterexamples show the `+2c\lfloor\cdot\rfloor` rule is not universal, invalidating the main hypothesis.
- Token 19073 [insight]: Reframes the recursion as a fixed-point iterate `F(n)=T^4(n)` with `T(x)=F(a+x)`, enabling a general derivation path.
- Token 20302-25880 [wasted]: Long speculative ratio/threshold analysis adds little beyond the fixed-point framing before the concise linear-in-`k` model is finalized.
- Token 25926 [insight]: Tracks block index behavior (`k=\lfloor(b-n)/a\rfloor`) under repeated `T` applications, setting up the final closed form.
- Token 27058 [breakthrough]: Derives the general formula `F(n)-n = d(a-c) + k\,(a+(d-1)(a-c))` (with `d=4`), which resolves the recursion globally.
- Token 27831 [verification]: Randomized brute-force tests confirm linearity-by-block and validate the derived `F(n)` structure.
- Token 29777 [verification]: Applies the sum formula to the provided example `(50,2000,40)` and matches the known `S=5204240`.
- Token 30052 [verification]: Additional random small-case sum checks pass against brute force.
- Token 30147 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{291504964}`.
