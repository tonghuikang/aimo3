## Problem pe-802: Periodic Points Sum

### Correct Answer: 973873727

### Problem Summary
Given map f(x,y) = (x^2 - x - y^2, 2xy - y + π) on R^2, find sum P(10^7) of x-coordinates of all points having period ≤ 10^7, mod 1,020,340,567.

### Key Insight
The map f corresponds to the complex map F(z) = z^2 - z + iπ where z = x + iy. This allows using complex dynamics theory.

### Correct Approach
1. Recognize f(x,y) corresponds to complex map F(z) = z^2 - z + iπ
2. Compute S_n = sum of all roots of F^n(z) - z = 0 (points with period dividing n)
3. Establish S_n = 2^{n-1} for n≥2, S_1 = 2 via polynomial coefficient analysis
4. Show sum of S_m from m=1 to t equals B(t) = 2^t (geometric series)
5. Use Mobius inversion: P(N) = Σ_{d=1}^{N} μ(d) * 2^{⌊N/d⌋}
6. Compute efficiently using sieve for Mobius function and grouping by floor(N/d) values

### Key Formulas
- S_n = sum of roots of F^n(z) - z = 0 = 2^{n-1} for n≥2 (S_1 = 2)
- B(t) = Σ_{m=1}^{t} S_m = 2^t
- P(N) = Σ_{d=1}^{N} μ(d) * 2^{⌊N/d⌋}

### Why It Works
The coefficient of z^{2^n - 1} in F^n(z) equals -2^{n-1}, making sum of all roots = 2^{n-1}. This is independent of the constant term iπ, hence the sum of real parts is always an integer.

### Both Traces
Both traces (7dpbsj and q8toko) follow similar approaches and arrive at the correct answer 973873727.
