## Answer: correct (5)

## Key moments
- Token 239 [breakthrough]: Reframes the problem as minimizing `lcm(a,b,c)` over distinct positive triples with fixed sum.
- Token 1766 [mistake]: After ruling out `M` itself, briefly suggests the minimum may have to exceed `M`, which later turns out false.
- Token 2037-2259 [wasted]: Uses broad small-`n` brute force to guess patterns, delaying the direct structural argument.
- Token 5484 [missed opportunity]: Already has the divisor-scaling framework but takes extra detours instead of immediately locking `T(3^k)=2/3`.
- Token 7452 [breakthrough]: Establishes `f(M)=2M/3`, then extends to `f(5M)=10M/3`.
- Token 12469 [verification]: Explicitly checks floor exactness using `3 | 2025!`, confirming `g(0)=2/3` and `g(4M)=10/3`.
- Token 16729 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{5}`.
