## Answer: wrong (no final answer)

## Key moments
- Token 294 [breakthrough]: Recasts the task as minimizing `lcm(a,b,c)` over distinct positive integers with `a+b+c=n`.
- Token 6992 [breakthrough]: Introduces the `a=c/p, b=c/q` parameterization and derives a usable ratio expression for comparing constructions.
- Token 25502-29914 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch on prime-factor casework for `D=pq+p+q` without converging to a valid minimal construction for `5M`.
- Token 31896 [missed opportunity]: Tentatively settles on `f(5M)=3^{N+1}=3M` instead of pivoting back to the already-viable `(p,q)=(3,6)` style path.
- Token 32006 [mistake]: Uses `p=2` with `c=3^{N+1}`, which makes `a=c/p` non-integer, so the candidate triple is invalid.
- Token 32671 [verification]: Correctly checks divisibility (`p|c`, `q|c`) via `c/p=n'q/D`, catching the flaw in the current branch.
- Token 32753 [final answer]: No explicit final numeric answer is committed before the trace ends.
