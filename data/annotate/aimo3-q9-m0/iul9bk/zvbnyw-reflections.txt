## Answer: correct (2)

## Key moments
- Token 164 [insight]: Interprets the first condition as support restricted to `\{0\}`, so `\alpha` is parameterized by `a=\alpha(0)`.
- Token 599 [breakthrough]: Reduces the shift-inner-product condition to `S_n(\alpha)\star\beta=a\beta(-n)`.
- Token 743 [breakthrough]: Uses integer-valuedness of `\beta` to force `\beta(-k)=1/a\in\mathbb Z`, giving `a\in\{\pm1\}`.
- Token 1029 [verification]: Confirms both sign cases are constructible by choosing `\beta` supported at `-k,-l` with values `1/a`.
- Token 1168 [questionable statement]: Briefly re-questions whether the first condition could allow other support patterns; this could have caused an avoidable detour.
- Token 1168 [verification]: Explicitly excludes the zero function (`a=0`) since it cannot produce the required two ones.
- Token 1572-1730 [wasted]: After concluding there are exactly two candidates, the trace rechecks shift-direction details without changing the result.
- Token 1755 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{2}`.
