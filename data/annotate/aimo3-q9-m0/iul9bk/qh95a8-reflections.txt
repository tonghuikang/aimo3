## Answer: correct (2)

## Key moments
- Token 223 [insight]: Interprets the first bullet as “support only at `0`,” so `\alpha` is determined by `a=\alpha(0)`.
- Token 688 [breakthrough]: Computes `S_n(\alpha)\star\beta=a\beta(-n)`, reducing the condition to arithmetic constraints.
- Token 951 [verification]: Uses the definition `\mathcal F: \mathbb Z\to\mathbb Z` to confirm `\beta` must be integer-valued, not just finitely supported.
- Token 1090 [breakthrough]: Concludes `1/a` must be an integer, forcing `a\in\{\pm1\}`.
- Token 1244 [verification]: Checks constructive feasibility for both signs by choosing two-point supported `\beta` values (`1` or `-1`).
- Token 1692 [verification]: Rules out `a=0` by noting it would make every shifted dot product identically `0`.
- Token 2256 [questionable statement]: Reopens whether there is a hidden subtle interpretation in the existential condition despite the reduction already fixing the form.
- Token 2256-3221 [wasted]: Repeats the same sign/integrality/existence argument and example checks after the result is already determined.
- Token 3295 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{2}`.
