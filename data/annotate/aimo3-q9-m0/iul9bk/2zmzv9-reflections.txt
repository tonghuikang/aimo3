## Answer: correct (2)

## Key moments
- Token 138 [insight]: Resolves the first condition as support at `0` only, reducing `\alpha` to `a\delta_0`.
- Token 588 [breakthrough]: Derives `S_n(\alpha)\star\beta=a\beta(-n)`, turning the functional condition into a scalar constraint per `n`.
- Token 631 [verification]: Rewrites the target pattern as `a\beta(-n)=1` on exactly two indices and `0` elsewhere, fixing the required shape of `\beta`.
- Token 828 [breakthrough]: Uses integrality of `\beta` to force `1/a\in\mathbb Z`, hence `a\in\{\pm1\}`.
- Token 1233 [verification]: Explicitly constructs `\beta` for both `a=1` and `a=-1`, confirming both candidates satisfy existence.
- Token 1747-3077 [wasted]: After already establishing `a=\pm1`, the trace repeatedly re-derives the same ambiguity/integrality checks without new progress.
- Token 1886 [questionable statement]: Reopens the vacuous-logic reading of “`m<0 and m>0`,” which could have invalidated the setup if followed.
- Token 3098 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{2}`.
