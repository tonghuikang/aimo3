## Answer: wrong (0)

## Key moments
- Token 531 [insight]: Correctly extracts from \(G(4)=25\) that only \(1!\) and \(4!\) can be in \(A\) among the first four factorials.
- Token 852 [breakthrough]: Correctly uses \(G(7)=745\) to pin \(6!\in A\) and \(5!,7!\in B\), establishing reliable small-case labels.
- Token 1296-5385 [wasted]: Long abstract graph/UFD reformulations do not produce a usable membership criterion or recurrence.
- Token 6403 [questionable statement]: Assumes the labeling should be multiplicative without deriving that from \(p(A,z)=p(B,z)\).
- Token 6457 [mistake]: Builds major deductions from that unproven multiplicativity, causing contradictions and repeated false starts.
- Token 10320-14669 [wasted]: Continues divisor-sum/algebraic manipulations without converting them into a validated computational method.
- Token 17749 [missed opportunity]: Correctly recognizes multiplicativity may be wrong, but does not reset to a principled derivation from the original constraints.
- Token 22543 [missed opportunity]: Identifies brute-force/constraint solving as a grounding path, but does not execute a stable solver.
- Token 28697 [questionable statement]: Introduces an ad hoc \(v_2\)-style sign rule from limited data.
- Token 36262 [mistake]: Tries to infer per-integer labels from aggregate \(G\)-values/mod sums, which is underdetermined and leads to pattern fitting.
- Token 43085 [questionable statement]: Conjectures “all even \(n\ge 4\)” factorials are in \(A\) from a tiny sample.
- Token 44255 [mistake]: That conjecture is explicitly falsified by the \(G(100)\) check.
- Token 48872 [missed opportunity]: Notices earlier conclusions depended on invalid assumptions, but still does not rebuild from proved structure.
- Token 58326 [questionable statement]: Introduces a prime-power/composite-style classification without deriving it from factor-pair constraints.
- Token 59179 [mistake]: Applies that unsupported classification to \(n!\), conflicting with known small cases and forcing more rewrites.
- Token 64862 [questionable statement]: Commits to another inert-prime/\(v_2\)-parity formula for \(\lambda(n!)\) without proof.
- Token 65901 [mistake]: The formula again fails against \(G(100)\), confirming the model is still incorrect.
- Token 74940 [missed opportunity]: After another global mismatch, continues empirical parity tuning instead of switching to a principled derivation.
- Token 81724-84460 [wasted]: Returns to abstract convolution/square-indicator speculation without producing a working algorithm.
- Token 85289-92485 [wasted]: Extensive heuristic rule sweeps and partial greedy attempts consume tokens without convergence.
- Token 92522 [questionable statement]: Shifts to a placeholder/guess mindset despite unresolved core derivation.
- Token 96255 [mistake]: Outputs an unsupported guessed value.
- Token 96255 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{0}\), which is incorrect.
