## Answer: correct (792169346)

## Key moments
- Token 1189 [insight]: Correctly extracts from \(G(4)\) and \(G(7)\) that \(1!,4!,6!\) are in \(A\) among early factorials.
- Token 5143 [questionable statement]: Starts with an overly simple multiplicative \(\chi=(-1)^{\Omega}\)-style model.
- Token 10173 [insight]: Brings in correct split/inert behavior mod 8 in \(\mathbb Z[\sqrt{-2}]\), which is essential structure.
- Token 17198 [mistake]: Reaches impossible \(\eta\in\{0\}\) behavior from incorrect divisor handling/exclusions.
- Token 22505 [breakthrough]: Reworks the model to track exponent-sensitive behavior (via \(g(e)\)) instead of naive \(\Omega\)-parity.
- Token 31158 [insight]: Stabilizes \(g(e)\) behavior for inert/ramified contributions and integrates it into the sign model.
- Token 37449 [breakthrough]: Confirms corrected local model on small computed cases, restoring consistency after earlier contradictions.
- Token 37648 [questionable statement]: Proposes an overly simple recurrence for \(\eta(k!)\) despite non-coprime dependency issues.
- Token 45030 [mistake]: That simplification is explicitly falsified; parity evolution is more complex than the proposed flip rule.
- Token 46625 [questionable statement]: Tries additional parity/popcount shortcuts that are not yet justified.
- Token 54748-61228 [wasted]: Long exploratory pattern-chasing phase before locking onto a scalable implementation path.
- Token 61228 [verification]: Performs the critical check that computed \(G(100)\) matches the provided \(709772949\) residue.
- Token 61630 [questionable statement]: Introduces a high-complexity block update optimization with delicate incremental sign maintenance.
- Token 64627 [missed opportunity]: Briefly shifts toward “likely infeasible” instead of pushing the validated model to completion.
- Token 68073 [mistake]: First optimized implementation gives incorrect outputs due update-order/sign-maintenance issues.
- Token 70320 [breakthrough]: Debugs and corrects the optimized approach, recovering consistency with known checks.
- Token 75746 [missed opportunity]: Again considers stopping before full-scale execution.
- Token 76773 [breakthrough]: Executes the full \(N=10^8\) run with the fixed optimized method.
- Token 76909 [final answer]: Commits to \(792169346\), matching the known correct answer.
