# Problem: pe-531

## Correct Answer
4515432351156203105

## Correct Approach
- For each pair `1000000 ≤ n < m < 1005000`, set `a = φ(n)`, `b = φ(m)`, `d = gcd(n,m)`.
- The two congruences
  - `x ≡ a (mod n)`
  - `x ≡ b (mod m)`
  are solvable iff `(b - a) % d == 0`.
- If unsolvable, `f(n,m) = 0`.
- If solvable, reduce to:
  - `n' = n/d`, `m' = m/d`, `rhs = (b-a)/d`
  - `t ≡ rhs * (n')^{-1} (mod m')`
  - `x = a + n*t`
- With `t` chosen modulo `m'`, this `x` is already the smallest non-negative solution (equivalently `x mod lcm(n,m)`).
- Precompute `φ(k)` by sieve up to `1005000`, then sum all pair contributions.
- Final total: `4515432351156203105`.

## Wrong Approaches

### 1) Restricting to coprime pairs only
- Wrong idea: assume only `gcd(n,m)=1` pairs contribute, and set all `gcd(n,m)>1` pairs to 0.
- Why it fails: many non-coprime pairs still satisfy CRT compatibility `(φ(m)-φ(n)) % gcd(n,m) == 0` and must be included.
- Wrong total from this approach: `3853736040972242698`.

### 2) Off-by-one upper bound (`m ≤ 1005000`)
- Wrong idea: include `1005000` in the range (using `[1000000, 1005000]` instead of `< 1005000`).
- Why it fails: the problem requires strict inequality `m < 1005000`.
- Wrong total from this approach: `4516457394922697105`.
