## Answer: correct (653972374)

## Key moments
- Token 181 [insight]: Connects adjacent-equality count to runs (`c = n - r`), setting up the combinatorial counting model.
- Token 768 [breakthrough]: Derives the explicit count as a truncated binomial sum over allowed equal-pair counts.
- Token 4918 [insight]: Rewrites `C(n)` as `6*5^N*sum_{c=0..pi(n)} binom(N,c)5^{-c}`, clarifying the structure needed for recurrence work.
- Token 12184 [insight]: Derives the core transition `f(N+1,p)=5*f(N,p)+f(N,p-1)`, the algebraic backbone of later updates.
- Token 14136-21113 [wasted]: Long sum-swapping/decomposition analysis mostly re-derives equivalent identities without yielding an immediately executable speedup.
- Token 23087 [questionable statement]: Prime-case update is framed with the wrong boundary index (`G(n-1,p)`-style reasoning), seeding an incorrect recurrence.
- Token 30523 [mistake]: Commits to the incorrect prime/composite recurrence and delta-based implementation, which overcounts early values.
- Token 33082 [missed opportunity]: Moves into full implementation details before a quick small-`n` sanity run that would have exposed the recurrence bug immediately.
- Token 39592 [verification]: Starts explicit base-case/sample verification against known `C(n)` values.
- Token 42735 [verification]: Detects concrete contradiction (`C(2)` predicted as 66 vs true 36), confirming the recurrence is wrong.
- Token 43889 [insight]: Re-derives from `C_n = sum_{c<=pi(n)} G(n,c)` and identifies the prime-case index shift as the actual source of error.
- Token 44765 [breakthrough]: Establishes corrected prime recurrence using `G(n-1, p_{n-1}+1)` rather than the previously used term.
- Token 45303 [breakthrough]: Converts corrected prime update into a computable `T_n*(n-2-p)/(p+1)` form and validates against brute-force checks.
- Token 46844 [insight]: Identifies `array('I')` inverse storage as the practical way to make O(L) modular-division updates feasible in memory.
- Token 52697 [breakthrough]: Implements the memory-efficient sieve + inverse-table + linear recurrence pipeline needed for the full `L=50,000,000` run.
- Token 54281 [final answer]: Commits final result `653972374`.
