## Answer: wrong (12480)

## Key moments
- Token 222 [insight]: Sets up the modular swap condition and correctly frames the leading-zero swap validity rule.
- Token 2222-6975 [wasted]: Long detour through inclusion-exclusion/complement formulations without a concrete executable count strategy.
- Token 3168 [questionable statement]: Proposes an incorrect 2-digit reduction (`a+b ≡ 0 (mod 7)`) for swap-to-multiple behavior.
- Token 3500 [mistake]: Finds a contradiction (`68 ↔ 86`) showing that derivation is wrong.
- Token 4422 [breakthrough]: Repairs the algebra and recovers the correct 2-digit criterion (`a+3b ≡ 0`, equivalently `b ≡ 2a (mod 7)`).
- Token 12292 [questionable statement]: Assumes class-level residue masks (plus limited extras) are sufficient to model all valid/invalid swaps.
- Token 20950 [mistake]: Commits to a compact state as "enough" despite unresolved MSD-vs-class ambiguity for zero-swaps.
- Token 25484 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly identifies that MSD-class aggregation cannot distinguish the unique MSD digit from other same-class digits, but this is not fully fixed in the transition logic.
- Token 32668-34686 [wasted]: Extended runtime/state-growth tuning discussion before addressing core correctness risk.
- Token 36775 [breakthrough]: Adds strong pruning (`forbidden mask` fully saturated), making large-length computation feasible.
- Token 45591 [verification]: Pruned DP produces consistent-looking per-length counts and scales to high lengths.
- Token 46725 [mistake]: Transition code still applies `if src == 0 and d == 0: continue`, effectively skipping all class-0 contributions instead of only the true MSD-position swap case, undercounting forbidden products.
- Token 48210 [verification]: Confirms early checkpoints (`C(100)`, `C(10^4)`) but these do not expose the high-length structural bug.
- Token 48592 [missed opportunity]: Skips deeper adversarial/differential validation after obtaining full-length totals, despite known modeling fragility.
- Token 48760 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{12480}`, which is incorrect.
