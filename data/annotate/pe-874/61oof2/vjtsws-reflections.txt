## Answer: correct (24777)

## Key moments
- Token 960 [questionable statement]: Assumes that using the smallest feasible total reduction `D0` on a single entry should be globally optimal for score.
- Token 2614 [mistake]: Commits to the single-reduction formula and treats overlapping-gap intuition as a proof of optimality.
- Token 4334 [missed opportunity]: Produces the provisional answer `19279` before stress-testing the optimization claim.
- Token 4391 [insight]: Starts small-`k` DP verification to challenge the closed-form assumption instead of finalizing early.
- Token 6281 [breakthrough]: Finds the `k=11` counterexample where DP beats the single-reduction formula, forcing a model change.
- Token 15612-23129 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch building a heap-based marginal-cost method with informal optimality arguments that later fail on tie-handling.
- Token 23297 [questionable statement]: Claims the greedy extraction remains optimal even with non-monotone marginals and tie-sensitive future states.
- Token 23657 [mistake]: Accepts `21599` from the flawed greedy approach as if the loss minimization were settled.
- Token 31236 [insight]: Recognizes tie-dependent failure and reframes the problem in a stronger optimization form.
- Token 33087 [breakthrough]: Recasts to unbounded knapsack on depth/cumulative-loss states and derives an exact DP for minimal loss.
- Token 35568 [verification]: Runs the corrected DP for `k=7000`, obtaining `loss = 60202` and corresponding score/modulo pipeline.
- Token 36121-36244 [verification]: Confirms the cumulative-loss identity (`cumcost[t]` equals single-entry reduction loss) to validate DP modeling consistency.
- Token 36636 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{24777}`.
