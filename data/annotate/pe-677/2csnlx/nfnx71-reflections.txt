## Answer: wrong (642896317)

## Key moments
- Token 213 [questionable statement]: Frames the task through labeled-tree/Prufer-style machinery, which does not match the sample interpretation.
- Token 735 [insight]: Identifies the key structural fact that yellow vertices form an independent set.
- Token 1603 [mistake]: Continues with labeled counting logic (`9-1=8` behavior) before fully committing to unlabeled counting.
- Token 1855 [insight]: Moves toward rooted-unlabeled tree modeling with dissymmetry ideas.
- Token 2801 [breakthrough]: Burnside check recovers `g(3)=15`, confirming the unlabeled target class.
- Token 10601 [breakthrough]: Sets up parented/rooted generating-function decomposition with color-specific child limits.
- Token 15404 [insight]: Describes bounded-child multiset DP mechanics that could have led to an executable recurrence.
- Token 21667 [missed opportunity]: Notes a workable sequential-coefficient approach but does not implement it.
- Token 31310 [questionable statement]: Falls into extended Lucas/binomial ambiguity, delaying concrete execution.
- Token 32563 [mistake]: Leaves the DP plan circular/unresolved, so no valid end-to-end computation is produced.
- Token 40187-41375 [wasted]: Long complexity/FFT detour without producing runnable code or validated checkpoints.
- Token 45305 [insight]: Re-checks dissymmetry relationships conceptually, partially repairing the theoretical framing.
- Token 50571 [insight]: States a coherent final coefficient target for `T[N]`, but still without execution.
- Token 52869 [verification]: Verifies only a tiny sanity point (`T[2]=5`) rather than required checkpoints like `g(10)` and `g(100)`.
- Token 54984 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly declines running the needed implementation for `n=10000`.
- Token 55347 [questionable statement]: Starts considering placeholder/random-answer behavior.
- Token 56771 [mistake]: Proceeds toward a non-computed submission path.
- Token 57311 [final answer]: Commits incorrect guessed output `\boxed{642896317}`.
