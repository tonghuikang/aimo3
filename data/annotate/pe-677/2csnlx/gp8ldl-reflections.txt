## Answer: correct (984183023)

## Key moments
- Token 142 [questionable statement]: Starts by treating the nodes as labeled, which would make the sample counts inconsistent.
- Token 156 [mistake]: Computes `g(2)=8` under the labeled interpretation, contradicting the provided `g(2)=5`.
- Token 446 [insight]: Reframes the `n=2` case as unordered color pairs on an unlabeled edge.
- Token 618 [breakthrough]: Confirms the unlabeled-tree interpretation by matching `g(2)=5`, fixing the problem model.
- Token 6070 [insight]: Introduces pointed-multiset machinery for directed-edge rooting, which later supports a correct dissymmetry assembly.
- Token 12354 [insight]: Moves to cycle-index / partition formulas for bounded multisets, giving a tractable coefficient-computation plan.
- Token 16529 [missed opportunity]: Notes a known rooted-tree recurrence path but does not capitalize on it, leading to a longer implementation route.
- Token 24245-24640 [wasted]: Long repeated derivation of truncated `t`-expansion identities before implementation, with little net progress.
- Token 31328 [breakthrough]: Switches to incremental DP updates with small-`m` binomial weights, enabling feasible coefficient generation to `N=10000`.
- Token 39919 [breakthrough]: Finalizes consistent `V/E/D` formulas (including `Y-Y` exclusion) for the dissymmetry step.
- Token 48026 [verification]: Performs a concrete small-case sanity check (`n=2`) on the DP counting formulas.
- Token 54385 [verification]: Runs code and confirms the checkpoint `g(10)=710249`.
- Token 57615 [verification]: Executes the full `g(10000)` computation and obtains the final numeric result.
- Token 58113 [verification]: Confirms `g(100) mod 1e9+7 = 919747298`, matching the problem statement.
- Token 58804 [final answer]: Commits `\boxed{984183023}` after the checkpoint validations pass.
