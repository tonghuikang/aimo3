## Answer: correct (75108)

## Key moments
- Token 338 [insight]: Sets up the core split `t(n)=f(n)-g(n)` using palindrome half-structure and a no-2 complement count.
- Token 747 [questionable statement]: Floats the remembered formula `2^{\lfloor(n-1)/2\rfloor}` for total palindromic compositions.
- Token 954 [breakthrough]: Re-derives counts from even/odd constructions instead of relying on the shaky recalled formula.
- Token 3595 [breakthrough]: Locks in `f(n)=2^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}` and reduces the hard part to computing `g(n)`.
- Token 3680 [questionable statement]: Uses naive `g(2m)=B(m)+S(m-1)`, which implicitly includes odd-center value `2`.
- Token 5770 [mistake]: The check at `n=6` gives `g(6)=5` and `t(6)=3`, contradicting the given `t(6)=4`.
- Token 6255 [insight]: Identifies the true source: odd-length contributions must exclude cases where center `c=2`.
- Token 7360 [breakthrough]: Corrects even case to `g(2m)=B(m)+S(m-2)` and immediately revalidates with `g(6)=4`.
- Token 8942 [verification]: Runs exact-value checks and matches known anchors (`t(6)=4`, `t(20)=824`, `t(42)=1999923`).
- Token 12826 [questionable statement]: Claims the period is `p=1,050,000` directly in `n`, without handling the `m=\lfloor n/2\rfloor` index mapping.
- Token 14559 [mistake]: Period argument conflicts with the found hit at `n=1,275,000` and would imply a false earlier repeat.
- Token 15120 [breakthrough]: Fixes the mapping and establishes the correct `n`-period (`2p=2,100,000`), restoring a sound minimality check.
- Token 15446-15793 [verification]: Re-scans lower ranges and boundary behavior to confirm no solution in `[43, 1,274,999]`.
- Token 16001-16106 [wasted]: Extra contemplation of huge exact-integer evaluation adds little after modular divisibility is already settled.
- Token 16793 [final answer]: Commits the final output `\boxed{75108}`.
