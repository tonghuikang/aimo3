## Answer: correct (6292)

## Key moments
- Token 255 [insight]: Frames the task correctly as a Burnside orbit count over sticker colorings under the move group action.
- Token 1225 [questionable statement]: Leans on the familiar `3,674,160` state count without yet resolving whether whole-cube rotations should be quotiented in this problem’s equivalence.
- Token 2455 [missed opportunity]: Has enough information to use the provided `n=2 -> 183` example immediately to settle the group-interpretation ambiguity.
- Token 2455-4518 [wasted]: Long back-and-forth about move-group size vs whole-cube rotations before switching to a concrete verification path.
- Token 6156 [breakthrough]: Derives the per-corner-cycle rule: twist sum `s=0` gives 3 sticker cycles, `s!=0` gives 1 sticker cycle.
- Token 7331 [insight]: Identifies that each cycle-sum residue has uniform multiplicity `3^(ell-1)`, enabling clean aggregation over cycle sums.
- Token 8033 [breakthrough]: Collapses the Burnside sum to dependence on permutation cycle count `m` via unsigned Stirling numbers `c(8,m)`.
- Token 9165 [breakthrough]: Chooses direct brute-force computation of `A(m,n)` for `m<=8`, avoiding unnecessary closed-form derivation.
- Token 9534 [verification]: Implements the counting routine and confirms `count_colorings(2)=183`, matching the statement’s calibration case.
- Token 10291 [verification]: Runs the same routine for `n=10` to obtain the target residue computation.
- Token 10352 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{6292}`.
