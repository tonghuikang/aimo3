## Answer: correct (71212)

## Key moments
- Token 1267 [missed opportunity]: Reframes chains as ordered factorizations of ratios but drops the line before extracting a usable counting method.
- Token 2735 [questionable statement]: Suggests the divisor-sum recurrence may imply multiplicativity of `g`.
- Token 2997 [mistake]: Pushes the multiplicativity assumption and runs into inconsistent `f(ab)=2f(a)f(b)` behavior, showing the inference is invalid.
- Token 6225 [insight]: Moves from raw `n`-space brute force toward exponent-vector structure and divisor-lattice DP framing.
- Token 6282 [breakthrough]: Recognizes `g(n)` depends only on the exponent multiset, enabling a factorization-pattern fixed-point test.
- Token 10513 [verification]: Programmatically checks the `(e,1)` family and validates which exponent choices actually match factorization constraints.
- Token 15353 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly notes vector enumeration is enough, but still spends significant effort chasing closed-form detours.
- Token 19207 [insight]: Identifies that vector generation order and subvector caching are the key to feasible exhaustive search.
- Token 23133 [breakthrough]: Commits to a concrete DFS over non-increasing exponent vectors with exponent-multiset factor checks.
- Token 30098 [missed opportunity]: Debugging detour around recursion/factorization behavior slows progress before the search pipeline stabilizes.
- Token 39809-44419 [wasted]: Long symbolic inclusion-exclusion derivation and formula reshaping does not materially improve candidate discovery.
- Token 48905 [verification]: Runs the full `10^16` bounded search and computes the candidate list and aggregate sum/mod result.
- Token 56883 [verification]: Re-runs with a larger exponent cap (`max_exp=80`) to confirm completeness of the found solution set.
- Token 57629 [final answer]: Submits `\boxed{71212}`.
