## Answer: correct (71212)

## Key moments
- Token 824-2113 [wasted]: Long attempt to count via saturated-chain refinements and block-merging overcounts before switching to a cleaner counting model.
- Token 2129 [insight]: Reframes the problem as ordered multiset partitions (Boolean/Fubini perspective for squarefree case, then generalized multiplicities).
- Token 3439 [breakthrough]: Derives the inclusion-exclusion formula for nonempty ordered blocks, giving a computable `G(E)` for exponent multisets.
- Token 5394 [verification]: Validates the formula on the known fixed point `n=48`.
- Token 9133 [verification]: Confirms the `(e,1)` family pattern `n=2^{2(p-1)}p` for odd primes within bounds.
- Token 11173 [missed opportunity]: Starts multiset search but with conservative caps that later prove insufficient.
- Token 14668 [missed opportunity]: Notes need for systematic structure but continues local pattern probing before broadening enumeration.
- Token 22999 [questionable statement]: Search uses a monotonic-break heuristic and `max_len=5`, creating a risk of missing longer exponent patterns.
- Token 23633 [mistake]: Prematurely reports a complete set (20 with `n=1`) before checking larger-length exponent tuples.
- Token 24106 [insight]: Explicitly questions the `max_len=5` cap and plans expanded search.
- Token 24939 [breakthrough]: Finds the missing `(1,1,1,1,1,28)` pattern (`5806013294837760`), correcting the earlier undercount.
- Token 26325 [verification]: Argues prune validity via monotonicity and confirms completeness of enumerated exponent multisets under limit.
- Token 26945 [verification]: Re-runs with larger limits (`max_len=10`, `max_exp=120`) and confirms stable solution count.
- Token 27496 [final answer]: Submits `\boxed{71212}`.
