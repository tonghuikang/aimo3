## Answer: wrong (no integer answer)

## Key moments
- Token 72 [insight]: Correctly starts from divisor-factorization structure for `d(n)=8`.
- Token 298 [breakthrough]: Completes the three-case decomposition (`p^7`, `p^3q`, `pqr`).
- Token 1104 [insight]: Writes the exact `p^3q` counting expression with explicit `q\neq p` handling.
- Token 3390 [insight]: Reframes the hard part as counting prime pairs for each smallest prime in `p<q<r`.
- Token 5455 [breakthrough]: Connects the triple count to semiprime-pair counting functions, giving a concrete algebraic target.
- Token 14715 [missed opportunity]: Recognizes outer-loop size is small (`p\le N^{1/3}`), but does not lock into a stable executable plan.
- Token 18252 [insight]: Derives the usable semiprime-pair formula `D(x)=\sum_{q\le\sqrt x}(\pi(x/q)-\pi(q))`.
- Token 23922 [breakthrough]: Simplifies the `p^3q` term to `\sum_{p\le N^{1/3}}\pi(N/p^3)-\pi(N^{1/4})`.
- Token 31954 [questionable statement]: Assumes broad caching/min-25 style precompute ideas are practical without establishing feasible resource bounds.
- Token 36723 [insight]: Resets the computation into explicit `A+B+C` components after extensive detours.
- Token 42090 [insight]: Builds an `\Omega`/smallest-prime-factor recursion view for the 3-prime component.
- Token 42445 [breakthrough]: Derives explicit `Q_2(x,a)` formula, a mathematically meaningful reduction for the nested count.
- Token 48909 [missed opportunity]: Starts implementation planning but does not commit to a validated end-to-end compute path.
- Token 54518 [insight]: Rewrites the main triple sum in terms of `D`-functions, preserving a potentially computable structure.
- Token 62022 [questionable statement]: Revisits an exponential recursion-style framing despite earlier evidence it is not tractable.
- Token 62022-70511 [wasted]: Extended reformulations repeat equivalent bottlenecks without producing a working exact algorithm.
- Token 70511 [missed opportunity]: Proposes an `r`-split strategy but never turns it into an executable counting routine.
- Token 78933 [insight]: Obtains concrete partial progress (exact `A`/`B` component values).
- Token 79102 [verification]: Computes `S2=\sum_{p\le\sqrt N}\pi(N/p^2)` numerically as a valid intermediate check.
- Token 80678 [questionable statement]: Declares inability to finish while still holding structured partial decomposition and checkpoints.
- Token 80704 [mistake]: Switches from exact computation to speculative guessing heuristics.
- Token 83192 [mistake]: Explicitly abandons the exact-answer requirement and repeats non-solution outputs.
- Token 84730 [final answer]: Ends with repeated “couldn’t determine the answer” finals (no integer provided).
