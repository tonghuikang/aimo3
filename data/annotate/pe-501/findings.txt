Correct answer
- For this problem, `f(10^12) mod 99991 = 26424`.

Correct approach
- Numbers with exactly 8 divisors must have prime-exponent pattern corresponding to one of:
  - `p^7`
  - `p^3 q` with distinct primes `p != q`
  - `p q r` with distinct primes `p < q < r`
- Therefore for `N = 10^12`, compute
  - `A = count(p^7 <= N) = pi(N^(1/7))`
  - `B = count(p^3 q <= N, p != q) = sum_{p <= N^(1/3)} pi(N/p^3) - pi(N^(1/4))`
    - The subtraction removes the forbidden `q = p` cases.
  - `C = count(p q r <= N, p < q < r) = sum_{p < q <= sqrt(N/p)} (pi(N/(pq)) - pi(q))`
- Then `f(N) = A + B + C`.
- Practical exact computation uses a fast `pi(x)` backend (e.g., validated Lehmer + caching) and verifies against given checkpoints such as `f(10^6) = 224427` before running `N = 10^12`.

Wrong approaches and why they fail
- Wrong approach 1: Unvalidated prime-counting implementation and formula toggling
  - Several attempts used inconsistent Lehmer / phi correction-term conventions (sign/index mismatches), failing known checks like `pi(10^7)`.
  - Despite failing validation, computation continued and ended with guessed output `70017`, which is not exact.
- Wrong approach 2: Asymptotic reasoning or repeated reformulation without exact execution
  - Treating the hard `p q r` term mainly via asymptotic scale arguments (or repeatedly rewriting sums) does not produce an exact value for `f(10^12)`.
  - One trace reached useful decompositions but never completed a correct executable counting pipeline, ending without an integer answer.
