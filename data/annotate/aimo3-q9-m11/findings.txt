Correct answer: 338

Correct approach:
- Encode sequences as Laurent polynomials so the condition becomes
  A(x)B'(x) = x^k + x^l = x^c(1 + x^d), with d>0.
- Therefore admissible A(x) have form A(x)=\pm x^s D(x), where D divides 1+x^d in Z[x], and support bound gives deg(A)\le 11.
- Divisors of 1+x^d are products of cyclotomic factors Phi_m with m|2d and m not dividing d. For fixed d, these m all share one 2-adic layer: v2(m)=v2(d)+1.
- So D is any product of distinct cyclotomic polynomials from a single v2-layer, with total degree <=11.
- Enumerating even m with phi(m)<=11 gives layers:
  - v2=1: m={2,6,10,14,18,22,30}, degrees {1,2,4,6,6,10,8}
  - v2=2: m={4,12,20}, degrees {2,4,8}
  - v2=3: m={8,24}, degrees {4,8}
  - v2=4: m={16}, degree {8}
- Count valid subset products D per layer (degree <=11), deduplicate the empty product once globally, giving 34 distinct D.
- For each D of degree r, shifts s=0..11-r and signs \pm contribute 2(12-r) functions alpha.
- Summing over all 34 D gives total 338.

Wrong approaches and why they fail:
- Wrong answer 752: overcounts by allowing cyclotomic factors from different 2-adic layers to be combined in one D. Those combinations cannot all divide a single 1+x^d.
- Wrong answer 68: undercounts by forcing A(0)=\pm1 and then counting only signed divisors D, which drops the monomial-shift family x^sD. The full family is A(x)=\pm x^s D(x), so missing shifts removes many valid alpha.
- Interim overcount patterns (e.g., 410): can happen if the empty-subset divisor D=1 is counted once per layer instead of once globally.
