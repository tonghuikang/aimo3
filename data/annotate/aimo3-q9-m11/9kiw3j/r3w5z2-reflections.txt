## Answer: correct (338)

## Key moments
- Token 2234 [missed opportunity]: Goes deep into an infinite linear-operator framing before switching to a much cleaner polynomial-factorization path.
- Token 3734 [insight]: Identifies the convolution/product correspondence, enabling direct algebraic treatment.
- Token 6071 [breakthrough]: Reframes shifty \(\alpha\) as polynomials dividing a binomial, then as \(\pm x^i\) times divisors of \(1+x^d\).
- Token 14903 [insight]: Recognizes the empty-subset polynomial is duplicated across \(v_2\)-group counts and must be deduplicated globally.
- Token 14979 [questionable statement]: Explicitly flags that duplication as a counting hazard needing correction.
- Token 15744 [breakthrough]: Correctly deduplicates and gets 34 distinct primitive \(f\)-polynomials.
- Token 15851 [verification]: Applies the shift/sign count \(2(12-\deg f)\) and builds the final summation framework.
- Token 20208-20772 [wasted]: Additional coefficient-behavior experiments and side checks continue after the core counting argument is already complete.
- Token 25808 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{338}\), matching the reference answer.
