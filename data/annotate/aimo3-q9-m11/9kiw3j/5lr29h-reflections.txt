## Answer: wrong (68)

## Key moments
- Token 1345 [insight]: Converts the shift-inner-product condition into a convolution/polynomial factorization equation.
- Token 2264 [breakthrough]: Correctly reduces the target to a binomial form \(x^k+x^l=x^a(1+x^d)\), which is the right algebraic entry point.
- Token 4305 [questionable statement]: Enforces a normalized model \(A(x)B(x)=1+x^d\) and infers \(A(0)=\pm1\), without preserving the original monomial-shift freedom in \(x^a(1+x^d)\).
- Token 5640 [mistake]: Concludes monomial factors \(x^s\) (\(s>0\)) are not admissible for \(\alpha\), incorrectly excluding valid shifted families like \(\alpha=x^sD\).
- Token 9618 [questionable statement]: Restricts the class to signed monic divisors only, implicitly treating that as the full shifty set.
- Token 14317 [mistake]: Final count uses only \(2\times\#\{D\}\) (giving 68), omitting the required shift multiplicity \((12-\deg D)\) for each divisor.
- Token 14529 [verification]: Performs consistency checks inside the reduced divisor-only model, so verification cannot catch the missing-shift family.
- Token 15678 [missed opportunity]: Could have tested a simple shifted divisor example (e.g., \(xD\)) to expose that constant-term-only filtering was too strict.
- Token 16658-19479 [wasted]: Long subset/polynomial enumeration continues on the narrowed model instead of revisiting the shift omission.
- Token 21150 [final answer]: Finalizes \(\boxed{68}\), which is incorrect (reference: 338).
