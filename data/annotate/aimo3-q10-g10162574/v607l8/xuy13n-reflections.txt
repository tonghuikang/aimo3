## Answer: correct (77)

## Key moments
- Token 170 [insight]: Frames the task as minimizing an integer via divisor-triple constructions for `N=M+c`.
- Token 4170 [questionable statement]: Adopts the `n-1` smallest-odd-prime-factor template as the primary global model.
- Token 5116 [mistake]: Commits to that `n-1` template too early, steering search toward a non-optimal branch.
- Token 10112 [verification]: Arithmetic/factor checks for the provisional `q=5081287` branch are internally consistent.
- Token 14620 [questionable statement]: Derives pair-style formulas but keeps them subordinate to the earlier `n-1` template.
- Token 15274-20269 [wasted]: Long branch-defense/mod-order work without reopening the core model assumption.
- Token 20269 [mistake]: Reasserts `f(n)=(n-1)(q-1)/q` as if final.
- Token 29534 [missed opportunity]: Small-case checks show tension, but pivot is delayed.
- Token 32220 [insight]: Rewrites the problem as `m=n-a-b` with divisibility constraints on `a,b`.
- Token 35019 [breakthrough]: Switches to the two-proper-divisor parameterization and ratio minimization search.
- Token 40051 [breakthrough]: Derives the correct feasibility conditions `D/gcd(D,alpha)` and `D/gcd(D,beta)`.
- Token 44990 [questionable statement]: Treats `30T/47` as potentially non-integer before leveraging the `47|T` fact.
- Token 45006 [mistake]: Briefly propagates that integrality doubt.
- Token 49510 [verification]: Restores exact floor handling and confirms `g(c)=30/47`.
- Token 50415 [verification]: Confirms competing families cannot beat the `(2,15)` feasible minimum.
- Token 52579 [final answer]: Commits to `77`.
