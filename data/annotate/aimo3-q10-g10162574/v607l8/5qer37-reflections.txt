## Answer: wrong (93194)

## Key moments
- Token 1124 [questionable statement]: Assumes the minimizing triple can be taken as `1,a,b` without proving global optimality over all triples.
- Token 1388 [insight]: Starts a structured gcd/lcm parameterization for the `1+a+b=n` branch.
- Token 1659 [breakthrough]: Commits to `f(n)=min lcm(a,b)` under `a+b=n-1`, establishing the main optimization model used later.
- Token 5471 [mistake]: Treats the `1+a+b=n` reduction as exhaustive, excluding better constructions where the chosen divisors are not forced into that form.
- Token 6495 [insight]: Correctly notices the `S/2` symmetric case violates distinctness and that odd factors must be considered.
- Token 7611 [questionable statement]: Promotes the "smallest odd prime divisor of `S=n-1`" criterion as the global minimization rule.
- Token 8101 [mistake]: Commits to `p0=5081287` as the decisive minimizer for `f(n)`, which drives the wrong branch.
- Token 16258-20109 [wasted]: Long big-integer remainder/gcd computations only validate arithmetic for the already wrong structural model.
- Token 22214 [verification]: Checks the floor perturbation condition (`epsilon < r/p0`) and confirms no carry in the chosen formula.
- Token 25065 [verification]: Performs final consistency checks (mod-4, divisor ordering, alternative q values) but still within the same incorrect framework.
- Token 26671 [final answer]: Commits to `93194`.
