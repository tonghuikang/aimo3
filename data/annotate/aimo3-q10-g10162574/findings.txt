# Findings: aimo3-q10-g10162574

## Correct Answer
- `g(10162574) = 30/47`
- In lowest terms, `p=30`, `q=47`, so `(p+q) mod 99991 = 77`.

## Correct Approach (Problem-Level)
- Let `n = M + c` with `M = 3^(2025!)`, `c = 10162574`.
- Write candidate divisors as `(m, m/alpha, m/beta)` with `alpha,beta > 1` and distinct.
- Then
  - `n = m * (1 + 1/alpha + 1/beta)`
  - `m = n * (alpha*beta) / (alpha*beta + alpha + beta)`.
- Feasibility requires divisibility constraints equivalent to requiring certain denominator terms divide `n`.
- The unconstrained best pair `(2,3)` gives ratio `6/11`, but it is infeasible here because `11 ∤ n`.
- Checking feasible low-ratio pairs, the best feasible one is `(alpha,beta) = (2,15)`, giving
  - ratio `30/47`
  - `m = (30/47) n`.
- For this instance, `47 | n`, so this `m` is integral and feasible.
- Therefore `f(n) = (30/47)n`.
- In `g(c) = (1/2025!) floor(2025! f(n)/M)`, the additive correction from `(M+c)/M = 1 + c/M` is tiny; and because `47 | 2025!`, floor simplifies exactly to `30/47`.

## Wrong Approaches and Why They Fail
- `n-1` smallest-odd-prime-factor model:
  - Uses a restricted family based on `1 + d + m = n` and concludes `f(n)` from the smallest odd prime divisor of `n-1`.
  - This is not globally exhaustive over all valid divisor triples.
  - It produces the wrong branch (e.g., final residue `93194` in one trace).

- Restricted `D = 1+u+v` search model:
  - Over-constrains feasible constructions to a narrower denominator family.
  - Misses valid better constructions that lead to the `30/47` optimum.
  - Leads to wrong output `g(c)=16/25` and residue `41`.

- Overgeneralized `n+1` branch yielding `f(n)=2(n-2)/3`:
  - Finds a valid-looking construction family but treats it as globally minimal without adequate exclusion of better feasible pairs.
  - Ends at wrong `g(c)=2/3` and residue `5`.

## Trace Outcome Summary
- Correct traces: `f3a5vi`, `flziaa`, `lgl1gv`, `xuy13n`.
- Wrong traces: `5qer37` (93194), `ii3zvh` (5), `kz7htf` (41).
