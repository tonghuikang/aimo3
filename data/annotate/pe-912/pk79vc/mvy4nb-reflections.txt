## Answer: correct (674045136)

## Key moments
- Token 1981 [insight]: Reframes integer order as shortlex/lex order on valid binary strings, setting up position-based DP.
- Token 2186 [breakthrough]: Switches the target to computing odd-ending strings' rank-position sums (and squared sums) within each length block.
- Token 3253 [missed opportunity]: Spends time on ad-hoc closed-form recurrences for `g/h/e` instead of committing immediately to a compact state-DP.
- Token 5752 [questionable statement]: Proposes an `e(m)` ending-with-1 recurrence without fully resolving boundary conditions.
- Token 6741 [mistake]: Applying that recurrence to small `m` gives inconsistent low-end values (`e(2)` mismatch), so the formula was incomplete as stated.
- Token 6946-8799 [wasted]: Long manual recurrence debugging and small brute checks for `e/h` are mostly superseded once the unified automaton DP is adopted.
- Token 11197 [insight]: Recognizes that trailing-ones state `s in {0,1,2}` is sufficient for all transitions.
- Token 12422 [breakthrough]: Derives subtree-composition formulas (count, odd-count, sum positions, sum squares with offsets), enabling full-block and prefix contributions.
- Token 18664 [verification]: Performs brute-force and random small-`N` consistency checks to validate the DP implementation.
- Token 19597 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{674045136}` after verification.
