## Answer: correct (13)

## Key moments
- Token 876 [insight]: Narrows the problem to the special argument `M+4M` and its structure.
- Token 972 [breakthrough]: Rewrites the objective explicitly in terms of `f(5M)`.
- Token 3570 [insight]: Introduces gcd-scaling to separate a small base triple from a large common factor.
- Token 3818 [breakthrough]: Converts the search into minimizing a ratio over divisor-compatible base sums.
- Token 6375 [insight]: Builds a concrete admissible construction reaching the `2/3` candidate ratio.
- Token 9613 [breakthrough]: Concludes `f(N)= (2/3)N = 10*3^{K-1}` for `N=5*3^K`.
- Token 10033 [verification]: Checks that the floor input is integral because `3 | 2025!`.
- Token 12103 [questionable statement]: Starts a broad unconstrained min-ratio experiment (`min_ratio` over generic sums).
- Token 12369 [mistake]: Interprets low ratio at `s=11` as relevant to this problem, ignoring admissible-sum constraints.
- Token 12369-12617 [wasted]: Continues the inadmissible-sum detour before returning to the constrained domain.
- Token 14670 [insight]: Re-centers the argument on valid triples `d*(x,y,z)` with `x+y+z` restricted by divisors of `N`.
- Token 14960 [breakthrough]: Re-establishes the valid lower bound `f(S)/S >= 2/3` on admissible sums, recovering the correct path.
- Token 15150 [verification]: Re-derives `g(4M)=10/3` with the floor handled explicitly.
- Token 15272 [final answer]: Commits to boxed `13`.
