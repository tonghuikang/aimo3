## Answer: correct (13)

## Key moments
- Token 324 [insight]: Identifies that evaluating `g(4M)` reduces to understanding `f(5M)`.
- Token 1466 [breakthrough]: Reframes `f(S)` as minimizing `lcm(a,b,c)` over distinct triples with `a+b+c=S`.
- Token 1921 [insight]: Introduces common-factor scaling (`a=dx,b=dy,c=dz`) to separate structure from magnitude.
- Token 2005 [breakthrough]: Derives the ratio form `f(S)=S * min(lcm(x,y,z)/(x+y+z))` over divisor-compatible sums.
- Token 8541 [insight]: Constructs explicit families for sums `5*3^a` that realize ratio `2/3`.
- Token 8782 [breakthrough]: Concludes the global minimum ratio across allowed sums is `2/3`.
- Token 9036 [verification]: Checks a concrete witness triple for `S=5*3^N` and confirms distinctness and LCM arithmetic.
- Token 14442-14534 [wasted]: Briefly reopens already-settled conclusion without adding new constraints or counterexamples.
- Token 15137 [verification]: Runs an additional sanity pass that no admissible family beats ratio `2/3`.
- Token 16590-16725 [verification]: Substitutes `f(5M)` into `g(4M)` and explicitly uses `3 | 2025!` so the floor is exact.
- Token 16797 [final answer]: Commits to boxed `13`.
