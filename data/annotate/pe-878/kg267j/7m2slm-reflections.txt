## Answer: correct (9242)

## Key moments
- Token 265 [insight]: Starts from the correct GF(2)-polynomial interpretation of XOR-product, setting up algebraic reasoning instead of raw integer arithmetic.
- Token 1388 [questionable statement]: Asserts an overly strong small-value bound (`a,b <= 1023`) from degree heuristics before proving cancellation-driven exceptions are controlled.
- Token 10465 [verification]: Brute-force check confirms the provided anchor value `G(1000,100)=398`.
- Token 13017 [insight]: Recognizes norm-1 units as orbit generators preserving k, which is the structural key to counting beyond primitive pairs.
- Token 13623 [mistake]: Keeps relying on the early small-bound framing as if complete, despite identifying unit-generated large representatives.
- Token 22239 [missed opportunity]: Moves into heavy graph/component machinery before first proving that chosen representatives uniquely capture global orbits.
- Token 27767 [insight]: Uses orbit-size intuition to estimate totals in the tens of millions, guiding the later corrected counting pass.
- Token 32135 [breakthrough]: Reframes counting around orbit/components and bounded traversal in degree space.
- Token 34740-35635 [wasted]: Spends a long implementation detour on component/BFS mechanics with unordered canonicalization issues.
- Token 36974 [verification]: Detects a severe inconsistency (`visited=9242` less than primitive mass), correctly flagging a logic bug rather than accepting output.
- Token 37371 [questionable statement]: Attributes failure mainly to degree-check coding details, while deeper orbit-identification assumptions are still unsettled.
- Token 38387-39143 [wasted]: Repeated debugging loop revisits the same contradiction without a clean proof that the decomposition is correct.
- Token 39829 [breakthrough]: Runs `compute_G_debug` and obtains coherent totals (`primitive count: 512662`, `visited: 23707109`), resolving the earlier counting pathology.
- Token 39958 [verification]: Verifies the required modular reduction `23707109 % 99991 = 9242`.
- Token 40059 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{9242}`.
