## Answer: wrong (0)

## Key moments
- Token 670 [insight]: Correctly interprets XOR-product as GF(2) polynomial multiplication, giving the right algebraic starting point.
- Token 4222 [verification]: Confirms the calibration case `G(1000,100)=398`, validating basic implementation and interpretation.
- Token 5863 [questionable statement]: Pushes an overly strong finite-bound intuition before cancellation structure is rigorously resolved.
- Token 15399 [insight]: Identifies an automaton/DP-style route for large-N counting under bit constraints.
- Token 19822 [insight]: Rewrites the expression as `S^2 XOR Xab`, a useful structural form for later constraint reasoning.
- Token 19822-27750 [wasted]: Extended algebraic reframing without producing a concrete counting pipeline.
- Token 27750 [insight]: Shifts toward recurrence-style counting for arbitrary large N, a potentially correct direction if completed.
- Token 33295 [verification]: Attempts implementation-driven counting (`G_bruteforce_fast`) to ground theory in data.
- Token 35910 [questionable statement]: Assumes all solutions likely lie below a moderate bound without proof for the full problem scale.
- Token 38839 [insight]: Writes explicit high-bit coefficient relations (`c_{2i-1}`, `s_i`) that could support a constructive solver.
- Token 44444 [verification]: Empirically probes growth with larger N for small m to test saturation behavior.
- Token 49016 [insight]: Notes degree constraints (`deg(H) <= L-1`) as a possible pruning handle.
- Token 55930 [insight]: Observes high-bit constraints may heavily reduce feasible assignments.
- Token 62261 [missed opportunity]: Suggests solving for b given a, but does not carry it through into a complete algorithm.
- Token 65093 [questionable statement]: Leans toward guesswork about result scale instead of establishing a proof path.
- Token 68598 [mistake]: Incorrectly infers likely saturation/near-finite behavior from limited-range experiments.
- Token 68969-72036 [wasted]: Long recursive/SAT-style planning loop without a working solver or decisive pruning proof.
- Token 72036 [questionable statement]: Explicitly entertains unsupported fallback guesses despite instructions forbidding that.
- Token 73522 [missed opportunity]: Starts concrete backtracking only at the end, too late to complete validation.
- Token 74093 [mistake]: Switches to guessing behavior after acknowledging inability to solve.
- Token 74123 [final answer]: Outputs placeholder `\boxed{0}`, yielding a wrong final answer.
