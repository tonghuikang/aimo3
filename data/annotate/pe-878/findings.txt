# PE 878 Findings

## Correct Answer
- `G(10^17, 1_000_000) = 23,707,109`
- `G(10^17, 1_000_000) mod 99,991 = 9,242`

## Correct Approach
- Interpret XOR-product as polynomial multiplication over `GF(2)`.
- Write
  - `K(a,b) = a^2 XOR (Xab) XOR b^2`
  - as a norm form in the quadratic extension `GF(2)[X,u]/(u^2 + Xu + 1)` via `N(a + bu)`.
- Use multiplicativity of norm and `N(u)=1` to get an orbit action preserving `k`:
  - forward: `(a,b) -> (b, a XOR (b<<1))`
  - backward: `(a,b) -> ((a<<1) XOR b, a)`.
- Count by orbits:
  - enumerate minimal representatives (seeds) with `k <= m`,
  - then iterate orbit steps while `a,b <= N` and sum contributions.
- For `m = 1_000_000`, degree constraints bound primitive search to a small finite region (practically enumerable), and orbit expansion to `N=10^17` gives total `23,707,109`.

## Wrong Approaches And Why They Fail
- **Over-tight direct bound (`a,b <= 1023`)**:
  - Using only naive highest-degree arguments misses cancellation/orbit-generated large representatives.
  - This undercounts badly.
- **Truncated linear-system model (`b` capped to ~20 bits, `a < 2^19`)**:
  - The truncation is not justified by the true orbit/unit structure.
  - Produces the wrong total `5,512,782`, i.e. wrong modulo value `13,277`.
- **Wrong orbit update using integer addition**:
  - Using `(a,b)->(b, a+2b)` instead of XOR addition breaks the norm-preserving dynamics.
  - Correct update must use XOR: `(b, a XOR (b<<1))`.
- **Saturation/placeholder reasoning**:
  - Extrapolating from small-`N` growth without a structural proof leads to incorrect conclusions (including placeholder `0`).

## Useful Sanity Check
- Any valid implementation should reproduce the given check: `G(1000,100)=398`.
