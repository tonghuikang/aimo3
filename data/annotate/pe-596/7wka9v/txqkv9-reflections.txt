## Answer: correct (734582049)

## Key moments
- Token 69 [insight]: Frames the problem as `T(R) = sum_{k <= R^2} r_4(k)`, reducing geometry to summatory representation counts.
- Token 163 [breakthrough]: Uses the four-squares formula `r_4(n) = 8 * sum_{d|n, 4 not dividing d} d`, opening a divisor-sum route.
- Token 1110 [questionable statement]: Treats `(+/-1, +/-1, 0, 0)` as part of the `n = 4` case, which is suspicious because it sums to 2.
- Token 1184 [mistake]: Concludes `r_4(4) = 48`, creating a contradiction with the known formula.
- Token 1721 [insight]: Flags the contradiction as a counting issue and pivots to explicit brute-force checking.
- Token 2129 [verification]: Runs brute force for `r_4(4)`, showing the count is 24 and exposing the earlier counting error.
- Token 3033 [breakthrough]: Resolves the contradiction and re-establishes confidence in the `r_4(n)` formula.
- Token 6219 [insight]: Observes the excluded `4|d` part can be rewritten with `N/4`, setting up the final simplification.
- Token 6518 [breakthrough]: Derives `T = 1 + 8 * (Sigma(N) - 4 * Sigma(N/4))` with `Sigma(M) = sum_{i <= M} i * floor(M/i)`.
- Token 6865-10343 [wasted]: Spends a long detour on alternative asymptotic/sublinear ideas instead of immediately executing the workable grouped-floor algorithm.
- Token 11960 [verification]: Validates the implementation against provided checkpoints (`T(2)`, `T(5)`, `T(100)`, `T(10^4)`).
- Token 12303 [final answer]: Commits to `734582049` for `T(10^8) mod (10^9 + 7)`.
