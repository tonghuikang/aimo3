## Answer: correct (734582049)

## Key moments
- Token 163 [insight]: Recognizes the task as summing the four-squares representation count `r_4(n)` up to `N = r^2`.
- Token 307 [insight]: Identifies the classical divisor-sum identity for `r_4(n)` as the right path.
- Token 445 [breakthrough]: Rewrites `r_4(n)` into divisor-sum form `8 * (sigma(n) - 4 * sigma(n/4))`, which makes cumulative summation tractable.
- Token 1506 [insight]: Swaps the summation order to convert the representation count into a floor-division weighted divisor sum.
- Token 1592 [breakthrough]: Derives `T(N) = 1 + 8 * sum_{d <= N, 4 not dividing d} d * floor(N/d)`, explicitly separating the `n = 0` origin case.
- Token 1875 [verification]: Checks the derived formula against small provided values (`T(2) = 89`, `T(5) = 3121`).
- Token 2921-5056 [wasted]: Explores asymptotic and alternative-theory detours that do not materially improve the concrete computation path.
- Token 6428 [insight]: Notices the excluded `4|d` contribution can be reduced to the same `S0` form at `N/4`.
- Token 6532 [breakthrough]: Collapses the target to `T(N) = 1 + 8 * S0(N) - 32 * S0(N/4)`, where `S0(M) = sum_{d <= M} d * floor(M/d)`.
- Token 14145 [verification]: Executes the grouped floor-division implementation and cross-checks with provided benchmarks (including `T(100)` and `T(10^4)`).
- Token 14601 [final answer]: Commits to `734582049` as `T(10^8) mod (10^9 + 7)`.
