## Answer: correct (79057)

## Key moments
- Token 114 [questionable statement]: States that the moved element's direction flips each move, which is not the Johnson-Trotter rule.
- Token 359 [insight]: Connects the prompt's "largest swappable" rule to Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter (largest mobile element) behavior.
- Token 545 [breakthrough]: Works through the ABC -> ACB -> CAB -> CBA example and confirms the process matches SJT transitions.
- Token 1350 [verification]: Uses the BELFRY=59 checkpoint to validate that swap count should be interpreted as 0-based SJT rank.
- Token 2524 [insight]: Recognizes that brute-force generation is impossible at n=18 and that a direct ranking method is required.
- Token 2695 [missed opportunity]: Starts a long re-derivation from first principles instead of jumping directly to the known recursive block/offset rank formula.
- Token 3816 [questionable statement]: Tries an insertion-direction assumption that is not yet anchored to the observed SJT order.
- Token 3982 [mistake]: The initial recursive insertion orientation gives reversed small-n ordering, signaling the direction convention is wrong.
- Token 3982-4292 [wasted]: Spends a long detour re-testing tiny cases to recover the correct orientation convention.
- Token 5136 [insight]: Notices that for the first block (tau=12), right-to-left insertion exactly matches the observed first three SJT permutations.
- Token 5449 [breakthrough]: Finalizes the correct parity rule: even subrank blocks move n right-to-left, odd subrank blocks move n left-to-right.
- Token 5998 [verification]: Implements `rank_jt` and checks agreement with generated SJT order for n=1..6.
- Token 7344 [verification]: Computes rank modulo 99991 after obtaining the full rank value.
- Token 7539 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{79057}`, which matches the correct answer.
