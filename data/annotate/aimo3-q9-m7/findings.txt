Correct answer: 116

Correct approach:
- Encode \(\alpha\) as \(A(x)=\sum_{i=0}^7 \alpha(i)x^i\). After reversing/index-shifting \(\beta\), the condition
  \[
  S_n(\alpha)\star\beta=\mathbf{1}_{\{k,l\}}(n)
  \]
  is equivalent to \(A(x)G(x)=x^k+x^l\) for some Laurent polynomial \(G\in\mathbb Z[x,x^{-1}]\).
- Hence \(A(x)=\pm x^p D(x)\) where \(D(x)\mid (1+x^d)\) for some \(d>0\), with \(0\le p\le 7-\deg D\).
- Divisors of \(1+x^d\) are products of distinct cyclotomic factors \(\Phi_{2m}\) that come from one fixed 2-adic layer (equivalently, the chosen \(m\) must share one common \(v_2(m)\)); mixing layers is not allowed.
- With degree bound \(\deg D\le 7\), relevant factors are:
  - \(v_2(m)=0\): \(\Phi_2,\Phi_6,\Phi_{10},\Phi_{14},\Phi_{18}\) (degrees \(1,2,4,6,6\))
  - \(v_2(m)=1\): \(\Phi_4,\Phi_{12}\) (degrees \(2,4\))
  - \(v_2(m)=2\): \(\Phi_8\) (degree \(4\))
- Count all nonempty subsets within one layer with total degree \(\le 7\), plus the empty product \(D=1\).  
  For each \(D\) of degree \(d\), there are \(8-d\) shifts \(p\), and 2 sign choices (\(\pm D\)).
- Total:
  \[
  \#\text{shifty} = 2\sum_D (8-\deg D)=116.
  \]

Wrong approaches observed:
- Wrong answer 178: treats any degree-feasible subset of \(\{\Phi_2,\Phi_4,\Phi_6,\Phi_8,\Phi_{10},\Phi_{12},\Phi_{14},\Phi_{18}\}\) as admissible, ignoring the single-layer \(v_2\) compatibility required by one fixed \(1+x^d\). This overcounts divisor patterns.
- Wrong answer 60: counts only \(\pm D\) choices (roughly \(2\times\#\)subsets) instead of also counting shift placements \(x^p\) via factor \(8-\deg D\), and also uses an over-broad subset admissibility model.
