## Answer: wrong (60)

## Key moments
- Token 994 [insight]: Recasts the condition in the group-ring/Laurent-polynomial view, connecting shifts and convolution to polynomial multiplication.
- Token 2149 [breakthrough]: Formalizes the criterion as divisibility in `\mathbb{Z}[z,z^{-1}]` via `A(z)G(z)=z^k+z^l`.
- Token 3265 [questionable statement]: Treats `A` as needing ordinary divisibility into `z^N+1` with nonzero constant term, which starts excluding monomial-shifted valid forms.
- Token 6033 [missed opportunity]: Correctly observes that factors of a single `z^N+1` share a fixed 2-adic pattern, but this constraint is not enforced in the final counting.
- Token 6078 [questionable statement]: Broadens to “any product of even-order cyclotomics works” using an LCM argument, which is too permissive for mixed 2-adic valuations.
- Token 9283 [mistake]: Collapses counting to `2 * (# degree-feasible subsets)` over all eight small even cyclotomics, overcounting admissible divisor patterns.
- Token 12114 [mistake]: Reasserts the constant-term restriction as essential, missing valid shifty functions with leading zeros (`x^t` shifts absorbed by Laurent `\beta`).
- Token 13284-14103 [wasted]: Runs extensive symbolic/bruteforce confirmation only inside the flawed classification, reinforcing the wrong total.
- Token 14832 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{60}`.
