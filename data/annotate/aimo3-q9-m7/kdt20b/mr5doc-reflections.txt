## Answer: correct (116)

## Key moments
- Token 1627 [insight]: Translates the condition into a polynomial equation \(A(x)G(x)=x^k+x^l\), reframing the task as divisibility in Laurent/polynomial form.
- Token 4282 [breakthrough]: Reduces admissible \(\alpha\) to \(A(x)=x^pD(x)\) with \(D\mid (1+x^d)\) for some \(d>0\), plus \(\deg A\le 7\).
- Token 10902 [insight]: Derives the compatibility rule that selected \(\Phi_{2m}\) factors must come from a single common \(v_2(m)\) layer.
- Token 14817 [breakthrough]: Enumerates all degree-\(\le 7\) candidate cyclotomic factors and organizes them into the three valid \(v_2\)-groups used for counting.
- Token 16800 [verification]: Runs subset enumeration with degree filtering and shift counting to compute a total of \(116\).
- Token 19592 [verification]: Re-checks filtered subset totals and reproduces \(116\), confirming the implementation-based count.
- Token 19618 [missed opportunity]: Already reaches the correct total but does not terminate, reopening repeated derivations and checks.
- Token 21471-22334 [wasted]: Extended extra verification planning/recounting that does not change the characterization or total.
- Token 23370 [verification]: Performs final manual contribution sum (\(100+16\)) and reconfirms \(116\).
- Token 24479 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{116}\).
