## Answer: correct (3)

## Key moments
- Token 643 [questionable statement]: Frames the problem as primarily identifying the unique globally safe column.
- Token 3701 [mistake]: Concludes guaranteed success requires eliminating all but one column (drifting toward a 5-attempt necessity).
- Token 12244 [insight]: Notices that after two discovered monster columns, those columns are guaranteed safe on the still-unknown rows.
- Token 12904 [missed opportunity]: Reopens one-failure/two-attempt speculation repeatedly instead of locking the upper-bound construction and moving to a clean lower bound.
- Token 14642 [breakthrough]: Gives the concrete 3-attempt plan (`col 1`, `col 2`, then route using those known columns), establishing `f(4) ≤ 3`.
- Token 21012 [verification]: Provides the adversarial two-attempt impossibility argument (both attempted columns can be chosen as monster columns), giving `f(4) ≥ 3`.
- Token 22084-22618 [wasted]: Long detour on non-adjacent switching and intermediate-column risk after the core strategy is already in place.
- Token 23199 [verification]: Repairs the routing justification by exploiting monster-free top row and safe row-specific switching logic.
- Token 25084 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{3}`, which is correct.
