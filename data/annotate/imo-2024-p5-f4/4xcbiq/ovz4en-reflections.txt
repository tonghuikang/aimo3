## Answer: wrong (5)

## Key moments
- Token 745 [questionable statement]: Treats the task as equivalent to identifying the unique globally safe column.
- Token 971 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly notes that non-vertical, row-by-row routing might avoid full safe-column identification, but does not pursue it.
- Token 2039 [mistake]: Converts the elimination framing into a lower-bound claim, assuming one discovered monster-column per failed attempt is the governing bottleneck.
- Token 2475-4272 [wasted]: Long repeated analysis cycles around the same elimination argument without testing constructive partial-information paths.
- Token 4444 [questionable statement]: Claims guaranteed success requires knowing each interior row’s monster column (or full safe-column certainty).
- Token 5474 [mistake]: Uses that premise to assert `f(4) ≥ 5`, excluding valid 3-attempt routing strategies.
- Token 7068 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{5}`, which is incorrect.
