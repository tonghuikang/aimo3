## Answer: wrong (5)

## Key moments
- Token 813 [questionable statement]: Recasts the task as necessarily identifying the unique globally monster-free column before a guaranteed win.
- Token 860 [missed opportunity]: Briefly notes zigzag/path-based success could exist, but does not pursue that direction.
- Token 2039 [mistake]: Turns the column-elimination framing into a lower bound, claiming one eliminated column per failed attempt is fundamentally limiting.
- Token 2973-6030 [wasted]: Repeats the same elimination-only logic across many variants instead of testing whether partial monster knowledge can already force a safe path.
- Token 6628 [questionable statement]: States that certifying the safe column set is required for guarantee, treating other route constructions as irrelevant.
- Token 6790 [mistake]: Concludes ambiguity among remaining columns implies guaranteed failure until all monster columns are found, leading to the incorrect `k+1` conclusion.
- Token 7413 [final answer]: Commits to `f(4)=5` / `\boxed{5}`, which is incorrect.
