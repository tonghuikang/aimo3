## Answer: wrong (420711201)

## Key moments
- Token 301 [insight]: Correctly reframes the task as finding `\max\{k: \lambda(k)<N\}` and returning that value plus one.
- Token 1570 [breakthrough]: Introduces the useful optimization view: choose `L<N`, require each selected prime-power lambda to divide `L`, and maximize the resulting product.
- Token 3280 [breakthrough]: Derives the correct structural formula `K(L)=2^{e_2(L)}\prod_{p\text{ odd},\,p-1\mid L} p^{v_p(L)+1}` with a separate 2-adic case.
- Token 4457 [questionable statement]: Starts rewriting `K(L)` into a form proportional to `L\cdot\prod_{p-1\mid L}p`, implicitly assuming `L` contributes only valid odd-prime powers.
- Token 4689 [mistake]: Commits to `K(L)=L\,c(L)\,\prod_{p\text{ odd},\,p-1\mid L}p`, which is not equivalent to the formula at token 3280 and distorts the objective.
- Token 5969 [mistake]: Continues by optimizing `L\cdot\prod_{p-1\mid L}p` (plus parity factor), so subsequent search is tied to the wrong target quantity.
- Token 6932-13341 [wasted]: Long implementation/planning segment built around the incorrect simplified objective instead of repairing the mismatch.
- Token 15450 [questionable statement]: Implements modular reconstruction as `K_mod = c\cdot L\cdot\prod_{p-1\mid L}p \pmod{10^9}`.
- Token 15542 [mistake]: Final modular computation uses that incorrect reconstruction, leading to a wrong last-9-digits result.
- Token 18156 [missed opportunity]: Validation only on `N=6` and `N=100` (cases that do not expose this specific algebraic error), so the bug survives.
- Token 21368 [missed opportunity]: Treats a strong log-gap check as decisive without reconciling it against the earlier correct exponent formula.
- Token 23034 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{420711201}`, which disagrees with the correct value.
