# PE 474 Findings

## Problem
Count divisors of `(10^6)!` ending with digits `65432`, modulo `10^16 + 61`.

## Correct Answer
- `F(10^6!, 65432) mod (10^16+61) = 9690646731515010`

## Correct Approach
- Let `L = 10^5 = 2^5 * 5^5`, and write a divisor as `d = 2^i * 5^j * q` with `q` coprime to `10`.
- From `65432 mod 3125 = 2932` (not divisible by 5), `j=0` is forced.
- From `65432 mod 32 = 24 = 8*3`, only `i=3` is feasible (other `i` fail parity/valuation constraints).
- Therefore `d = 2^3 q`, and constraints become:
  - `q ≡ 3 (mod 4)`
  - `q ≡ 2932 * 8^{-1} ≡ 1929 (mod 3125)`
- CRT gives a unique class modulo `12500`: `q ≡ 8179 (mod 12500)`.
- So the task is: count divisors `q` of
  - `Q = (10^6)! / (2^{v2((10^6)!)} 5^{v5((10^6)!)} )`
  - such that `q ≡ 8179 (mod 12500)`.
- Count this with DP on `G = (Z/12500Z)^*` (`|G|=5000`), updating by each prime `p != 2,5` using cycle/order structure of multiplication by `p` in `G`, with multiplicities from exponent bounds in `(10^6)!`.

## Wrong Approaches And Failure Modes
- **Unjustified exact uniformity assumption** (`count = total_divisors(Q)/5000`) is risky if not proven; it can fail on smaller instances and needs explicit justification.
- **Inconsistent multi-mod CRT pipeline** (o56aj7 trace): residue computations across different helper primes became contradictory; the run still selected a subset of congruences and produced the wrong final value `5824404569480022`.
- The inconsistent branch was tied to fragile numeric implementation choices (notably overflow-prone intermediate arithmetic in one fast path), plus proceeding without fully reconciling contradictory modulus checks.

## Trace Status
- Correct traces: `btk5gx`, `uhdkjy`
- Wrong trace: `o56aj7`
