## Answer: correct (9690646731515010)

## Key moments
- Token 122 [insight]: Reframes the task as counting divisors of `10^6!` in a fixed residue class modulo `10^5`.
- Token 1173 [breakthrough]: Commits to CRT decomposition (`mod 32` and `mod 3125`), which is the structural reduction used throughout.
- Token 2094 [questionable statement]: Starts manipulating the `2^{e2}5^{e5}t` congruences while still uncertain about invertibility in the `5^5` component.
- Token 2750 [breakthrough]: Correctly forces `e5=0` from `2932 mod 5 != 0`, collapsing a large branch of cases.
- Token 10189 [missed opportunity]: Dives into long uniformity speculation before fully finishing the easier valuation lock on the `2`-adic side.
- Token 16321 [insight]: Sets up the right divisibility-style handling of `2^{e2} t ≡ 24 (mod 32)` by dividing powers of 2 carefully.
- Token 16970 [breakthrough]: Identifies that only `e2=3` is feasible; this is the key valuation lock-in for the divisor shape.
- Token 17053 [insight]: Sets the coupled target `t ≡ 3 (mod 4)` plus a `mod 3125` condition, preparing the single-residue reduction.
- Token 18103 [breakthrough]: Reduces the remaining condition to `t ≡ 8179 (mod 12500)`, turning the target into a unit-group counting problem.
- Token 18500 [questionable statement]: Treats full unit-residue uniformity as a working assumption to convert the 8 valid residues into a fixed fraction.
- Token 18781 [mistake]: Commits early to `F = total_divisors(N') / 5000` as if already proven, while the uniformity condition is still only heuristic.
- Token 19540 [missed opportunity]: Notices small-`n` non-uniform behavior but delays switching to a direct proof path, prolonging uncertainty.
- Token 22151-22315 [wasted]: Spends substantial effort on extra empirical checks and side tests after the core residue reduction is already in place.
- Token 30118 [insight]: Re-expresses the count in group/character terms (`qH+R` style decomposition), which is the right route to justify uniformity.
- Token 34743 [missed opportunity]: Briefly considers reduced-modulus structure but does not capitalize on it to close the proof quickly.
- Token 42000 [breakthrough]: Consolidates the argument back to the computable formula `total_divisors(N') / 5000`.
- Token 48536 [verification]: Runs an explicit DP-style check on a controlled case (`n=3003`) to validate the uniformity-based formula.
- Token 49241 [breakthrough]: Confirms `total/5000 == dp[target]` in the verification experiment, closing the main proof gap.
- Token 49498 [final answer]: States `\boxed{9690646731515010}` as the final value, which matches the correct trace outcome.
