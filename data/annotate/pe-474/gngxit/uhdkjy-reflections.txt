## Answer: correct (9690646731515010)

## Key moments
- Token 6 [insight]: Recasts the task as counting divisors of `10^6!` in one residue class modulo `10^5`.
- Token 987 [breakthrough]: Splits the condition via CRT and factors `N! = 2^{E2} 5^{E5} Q`, isolating the coprime part `Q`.
- Token 1888 [insight]: Starts valuation-based filtering of feasible `(i,j)` exponents from the target residues.
- Token 3139 [questionable statement]: Temporarily treats division by `2^i` in `mod 32` too loosely before fully reconciling non-invertibility details.
- Token 3851 [breakthrough]: Correctly forces `j=0` from the `mod 5` condition and narrows feasible `i` values.
- Token 6192 [mistake]: Keeps an `i=0` branch alive and explores its CRT class even though oddness/parity constraints already rule it out.
- Token 6765 [breakthrough]: Resolves the branch ambiguity and fixes the unique viable case `i=3`, reducing to `q ≡ 8179 (mod 12500)`.
- Token 8437 [missed opportunity]: Moves into a heavy character-FFT route before committing to the simpler direct group-DP approach.
- Token 10023 [breakthrough]: Pivots from pure character sums to explicit finite-state DP over the `2 × 2500` group representation.
- Token 15104 [insight]: Uses per-prime cycle/order structure (`base + remainder`) to compress exponent contributions.
- Token 20014 [insight]: Formalizes the 2D state transition model that makes the DP computationally tractable.
- Token 24959-30344 [wasted]: Spends a long span on alternate character/NTT formulations that are ultimately not the path used for the final computation.
- Token 34902 [breakthrough]: Introduces discrete-log parameterization modulo `3125`, enabling compact cycle-based updates.
- Token 40019 [insight]: Gives the practical complexity framing (`~5000` states across all primes), validating that a direct implementation is feasible.
- Token 45018 [verification]: Begins targeted small-case checks (single/paired-prime behavior) to validate transition mechanics.
- Token 47273 [verification]: Investigates and reconciles discrepancies against brute-force/smaller reference computations.
- Token 48567 [verification]: Confirms the modulo-`P` DP logic is consistent with exact-count behavior under linear operations.
- Token 50181 [breakthrough]: Implements the final `compute_F_n_modP` pipeline used for the real `N=10^6` run.
- Token 51496 [verification]: Executes the full computation and obtains `9690646731515010`, then checks mapping consistency back to `d=65432`.
- Token 52123 [final answer]: Commits `\boxed{9690646731515010}`.
