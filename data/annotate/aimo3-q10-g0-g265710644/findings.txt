# Problem: aimo3-q10-g0-g265710644

## Problem Statement
Find smallest n-Norwegian integer (integer with 3 distinct divisors summing to n).
Given M = 3^{2025!}, compute g(c) = floor(2025! * f(M+c) / M) / 2025! for c = 0 and c = 265710644.
Find p + q (mod 99991) where p/q = g(0) + g(265710644) in lowest terms.

## Correct Answer: 677
- g(0) = 2/3 (from D=27 with triple (3, 6, 18) giving ratio 18/27 = 2/3)
- g(265710644) = 64/97 (from D=97 with triple (1, 32, 64) giving ratio 64/97)
- Sum = 2/3 + 64/97 = 386/291
- p + q = 386 + 291 = 677

## Key Insights
1. **Factorization of c+1**: 265710645 = 3^3 * 5 * 97 * 103 * 197
2. **Smallest divisor >= 6**: 97 (since 5 < 6, next candidate is 97)
3. **Optimal triple for sum 97**: (1, 32, 64) with LCM = 64, ratio = 64/97 ≈ 0.6598
4. **Alternative triple for sum 197**: (2, 65, 130) with LCM = 130, ratio = 130/197 ≈ 0.6599

## Wrong Approaches
1. **Wrong answer 1375**: Uses D=197 instead of D=97
   - Computes g(265710644) = 130/197 instead of 64/97
   - Sum = 2/3 + 130/197 = 784/591
   - Gets p + q = 784 + 591 = 1375

2. **Wrong answer 93101** (qg8mos.txt): Uses wrong formula for f(M)
   - Treats M = 3^K as generic integer, uses f(n) = S*(d-1)/d where d=smallest divisor of S=n-1
   - For S = M-1 divisible by 4 (not 3), gets d=4 and f(M) = 3(M-1)/4 (ratio 0.75)
   - Correct: f(M) = 2M/3 using D=27 with triple (3, 6, 18), ratio = 2/3 ≈ 0.667
   - The trace fails to recognize that M's divisors are powers of 3, missing the better ratio
   - Gets g(0) = 3/4 instead of 2/3, and g(c) = 3/4 instead of 64/97

## Critical Decision Points
The key error in wrong traces is using only the (c/p, c/q, c) triple formula:
- This formula finds triples where f(n) = n * (pq/D) with D = pq + p + q
- For D=197: (p,q) = (2,65) gives ratio 130/197
- For D=97: (p,q) = (6,13) gives ratio 78/97 ≈ 0.804 (WORSE than 197!)

The correct approach considers all triple types:
- For sum 97: triple (1, 32, 64) has LCM = 64, ratio = 64/97 ≈ 0.6598 (BETTER than 197!)
- This is the pattern 1 + 2^k + 2^{k+1} = 1 + 3*2^k = 97, so k=5

Wrong traces fail because they only search for (c/p, c/q, c) triples and miss that
the (1, 2^k, 2^{k+1}) pattern gives a better ratio for D=97.
