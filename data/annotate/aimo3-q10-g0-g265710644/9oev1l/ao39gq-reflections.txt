## Answer: correct (677)

## Key moments
- Token 11120 [mistake]: Starts from `f(M)=3(M-1)/4`, which puts the trace on a wrong `3/4` baseline.
- Token 15882 [mistake]: Carries that branch through to a coherent but incorrect closed form.
- Token 21004 [verification]: Runs code-level checks that validate internal consistency of the wrong model rather than the true objective.
- Token 30340-30536 [wasted]: Continues arguing for the `q=4` path and underweights better divisor-ratio constructions.
- Token 41437 [breakthrough]: Moves to explicit candidate-pair divisibility testing, enabling a correct search method.
- Token 54040 [breakthrough]: Identifies the decisive `(x,y)=(2,64)` path with ratio `64/97`.
- Token 58650 [mistake]: Still reports wrong interim answer (`59`) before fully correcting the `f(M)` branch.
- Token 66867 [mistake]: Another incorrect interim total (`36952`) appears during reconciliation.
- Token 69222 [breakthrough]: Corrects both branches together and lands on `2/3 + 64/97`.
- Token 71707 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{677}`.
