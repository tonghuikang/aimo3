## Answer: wrong (0)

## Key moments
- Token 110 [insight]: Correctly reframes k-Ruff numbers as integers coprime to the prime-product modulus.
- Token 1556 [insight]: Correctly notes that last-digit-7 already handles coprimality with 2 and 5, so only the 7-ending primes remain.
- Token 2254 [breakthrough]: Reduces `a=10m+7` to forbidding one residue `m ≡ r_i (mod p_i)` per prime.
- Token 3989 [breakthrough]: Moves to inclusion-exclusion over forbidden residue classes, the right high-level direction.
- Token 4845-9863 [wasted]: Long setup repeatedly restates huge-modulus concerns without locking a computable closed form.
- Token 9863 [questionable statement]: Floats the possibility that shifted forbidden residues might still preserve a near-`Mφ(M)/2` sum structure.
- Token 16380 [questionable statement]: Treats inverse-product subset sums as if they can be manipulated as manageable integer objects despite `2^(k-1)` growth.
- Token 16825 [mistake]: Mixes modular and integer interpretations of inverse-product terms, producing inconsistent correction quantities.
- Token 18199 [verification]: Uses small-`k` tests to check whether coefficient handling is stable; test pressure correctly exposes inconsistencies.
- Token 24414 [questionable statement]: Proposes a candidate closed form for `D` from small cases before resolving modulo-reduction effects in `R_J`.
- Token 29542 [mistake]: Derived decomposition yields values that contradict direct small-case inclusion-exclusion, confirming the formula chain is broken.
- Token 34514-39343 [wasted]: Extended DP redesign attempts for correction terms, but no tractable state formulation emerges.
- Token 39343 [verification]: Manual component checks on small cases clearly show discrepancy magnitude and sign issues.
- Token 45124 [insight]: Keeps the correct top-level target relation `F = 10*sum_m + 7*phi(M)` in view.
- Token 51339 [verification]: Re-checks term-level contributions; mismatch persists, confirming unresolved core derivation error.
- Token 55726 [breakthrough]: Correctly identifies one root issue: omitted modulo reduction of `R_J` in earlier expansion.
- Token 60345 [missed opportunity]: Recognizes a missing integer-floor term but does not convert it into a computable aggregate formula.
- Token 65991 [questionable statement]: Continues proposing subset-product DP variants without a valid complexity reduction argument.
- Token 71730 [missed opportunity]: Concludes certain distributions are not uniform but does not leverage the correct-trace algebraic simplification path.
- Token 74770 [questionable statement]: Attempts to separate floor-coupled contributions by index even though denominators remain entangled.
- Token 78623 [mistake]: Applies non-separable floor decomposition heuristics, leading to another dead-end derivation.
- Token 83681-92359 [wasted]: Late trace oscillates among speculative formulas and alternate DPs without converging to a validated method.
- Token 92246 [questionable statement]: Guesses a “small correction” pattern from tiny-`k` behavior without derivation.
- Token 94563 [missed opportunity]: Stops after difficulty instead of grounding on the known `k=3` target plus a complete symbolic route.
- Token 96134 [final answer]: Commits `\boxed{0}` without a completed or verified derivation for `k=97`.
