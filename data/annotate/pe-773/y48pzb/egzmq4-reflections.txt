## Answer: correct (556206950)

## Key moments
- Token 417 [insight]: Reframes the task as summing numbers `n ≡ 7 (mod 10)` while only needing to exclude divisibility by the `k` primes ending in 7.
- Token 2290 [insight]: Converts to the `t`-space view (`n = 10t + 7`) with one forbidden residue per prime, making CRT/inclusion-exclusion feasible.
- Token 3020-7181 [wasted]: Long CRT-coefficient derivation assumes direct linear sum transfer and spends many tokens on coefficient-modulo concerns before validating the reduction effect.
- Token 7181 [questionable statement]: Treats the CRT linear form as if summing unreduced coefficients should preserve the true sum over representatives.
- Token 7463 [mistake]: Realizes the earlier sum formula ignored per-tuple modulo-`P` reduction, so computed totals are biased.
- Token 7507 [breakthrough]: Switches to direct inclusion-exclusion over forbidden congruence classes, avoiding the invalid unreduced CRT-sum shortcut.
- Token 8494 [insight]: Notices subset constraints collapse to `10t ≡ -7 (mod P_S)`, simplifying each intersection class.
- Token 10015 [breakthrough]: Factors `Σ_S (-1)^|S| / M_S` into a product form, enabling compact closed-form handling of one major term.
- Token 10346-18145 [wasted]: Extended fractional/modular manipulations around `t_bad/M_S`, with repeated reformulations before landing a stable parameterization.
- Token 11297 [questionable statement]: Tries to force a global closed form for `Σ_S (-1)^|S| t_bad/M_S` before pinning down the subset-dependent quotient structure.
- Token 12045 [mistake]: Uses a derived expression that numerically disagrees with the trusted `k=3` value, showing the algebra is still incomplete.
- Token 20102 [breakthrough]: Identifies that the quotient term `k_S` depends only on `|S| mod 4`, collapsing subset dependence to binomial-class sums.
- Token 21266 [insight]: Rewrites key subset sums as `Σ_s (-1)^s C(k,s) * pattern(s mod 4)`, making `F_f` and `K` computable in `O(k)`.
- Token 24597-30619 [wasted]: Multiple re-derivations reconcile sign conventions and term structure; progress is real but circuitous.
- Token 32493 [questionable statement]: Proposes `G = (C + PK)/10` without handling the special empty-subset inverse case.
- Token 36362 [mistake]: Using that `G` expression yields non-integer behavior at `k=3`, exposing the missing empty-subset correction.
- Token 43888 [breakthrough]: Corrects to `G = (C + P*(K-1))/10`, restoring consistency with integer checks and prior small-case totals.
- Token 44520 [verification]: Full reconstructed formula reproduces the known `k=3` target exactly.
- Token 45452 [verification]: Runs the finalized derived routine for `k=97` after passing the sample check.
- Token 45528 [final answer]: Commits `\boxed{556206950}`.
