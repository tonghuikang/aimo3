## Answer: wrong (no final answer)

## Key moments
- Token 16 [insight]: Correctly reduces the objective to summing numbers `< N_k` that are coprime to `N_k` and end in 7.
- Token 2205 [questionable statement]: Suggests coset multiplication might preserve integer representative sums across mod-10 classes.
- Token 4743 [breakthrough]: Pivots to character/inclusion-exclusion style tools instead of raw enumeration.
- Token 7418 [insight]: Uses `a = 10m + 7` and the per-prime forbidden-residue view.
- Token 9863 [questionable statement]: Speculates that shifted forbidden residues might still leave a near `M*phi(M)/2` sum symmetry.
- Token 12416 [verification]: Runs small-case CRT coefficient checks to test structural conjectures.
- Token 16879 [questionable statement]: Tries to justify using only modular representatives for `e_i`, while noting possible ambiguity from `+qM` lifts.
- Token 17446 [missed opportunity]: Flags the representation issue but does not lock a rigorous invariant to avoid coefficient-lift drift.
- Token 24324 [questionable statement]: Proposes a compact formula for `D` from small-k behavior before modulo-reduction effects are resolved.
- Token 28676 [mistake]: Uses a simplified `D = Σ a_i Q_i S_i` route that later conflicts with direct inclusion-exclusion values.
- Token 32783 [verification]: Evaluates the k=3 pipeline and observes disagreement with the known sample target.
- Token 37489-77415 [wasted]: Long sequence of `S_i/L_i/K` reformulations and DP variants without a convergent, validated correction term.
- Token 50033 [questionable statement]: Assumes cancellation will keep `S_i` behavior manageable for large k, without proof.
- Token 58432 [verification]: Re-checks sign variants (`D` vs `-D`) and still cannot reconcile with direct k=3 computation.
- Token 65136 [missed opportunity]: Compares component contributions but continues inside the same broken decomposition family.
- Token 73138 [mistake]: Derived `L_i` correction gives `D=-8148` versus direct `D=658`, confirming the chain is mathematically inconsistent.
- Token 77415 [questionable statement]: Introduces floor-carry DP ideas without establishing separability of mixed-denominator terms.
- Token 83497-99423 [wasted]: Late-stage oscillation among ad hoc DP, symmetry arguments, and pattern guessing.
- Token 90215 [questionable statement]: Hypothesizes equal class sums by mod-10 symmetry.
- Token 94803 [mistake]: Applies a class-sum formula that is contradicted by the explicit N=70 counterexample in-trace.
- Token 99423 [breakthrough]: Switches to a character-sum construction as a new tractable direction.
- Token 105300 [questionable statement]: Assumes the Gaussian-integer modular implementation is sound before full consistency checks.
- Token 107105 [verification]: Performs the required k=3 sanity check on the character implementation.
- Token 109887 [final answer]: Trace ends after `print(compute_F_via_characters(3))` (output in trace is wrong for k=3), with no computed/committed `F(97)` value.
