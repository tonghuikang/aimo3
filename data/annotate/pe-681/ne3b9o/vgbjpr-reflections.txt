## Answer: wrong (0)

## Key moments
- Token 807 [insight]: Reframes the geometry using \(x=s-a, y=s-b, z=s-c, w=s-d\), exposing the ordered-factor viewpoint.
- Token 1672 [breakthrough]: Establishes the core reduction to sorted positive quadruples with \(xyzw=m^2\), even sum, and perimeter contribution \(x+y+z+w\).
- Token 3132 [questionable statement]: Uses a worst-case ordered-factor count as a direct feasibility proxy for the constrained problem.
- Token 3414 [mistake]: Concludes direct enumeration is infeasible, even though unordered constrained tuples are much smaller than the ordered bound used here.
- Token 3424 [missed opportunity]: Switches to multiplicative/Burnside machinery instead of implementing the tractable divisor-enumeration path.
- Token 8102-20844 [wasted]: Long permutation/Burnside detour tries to recover unordered weighted sums but does not produce a workable way to enforce parity and max-versus-sum constraints.
- Token 22978 [verification]: Small-case check exposes a major mismatch (e.g., SP(10) coming out far above 186), confirming the current counting model is overinclusive.
- Token 23104 [breakthrough]: Identifies the missing validity filters: even total sum and \(x_1 < x_2+x_3+x_4\).
- Token 24404 [verification]: Re-validates with direct constrained enumeration against the provided small targets, confirming the corrected constraint set.
- Token 29106 [insight]: Returns to a concrete per-\(m\) divisor-loop strategy that can directly enforce ordering, parity, and inequality.
- Token 33314 [breakthrough]: Commits to factor-enumeration over side brute force and keeps the computation in the transformed-variable space.
- Token 39657 [questionable statement]: Treats rough aggregate \(d_4\)-style growth as decisive evidence that recursive factor enumeration cannot scale.
- Token 40959 [mistake]: Rejects the recursive route too early based on pessimistic scaling assumptions rather than a finalized optimized implementation.
- Token 49173 [breakthrough]: Implements a full nested divisor-loop enumerator with the right validity checks in place.
- Token 53108 [verification]: Uses explicit counterexample structure to confirm parity is not automatic for square products, preventing silent overcounting.
- Token 58486 [questionable statement]: Extrapolates partial runtime/count data to near-billion-scale conclusions and treats that as definitive.
- Token 58792 [mistake]: Uses that extrapolation to abandon the working enumeration path.
- Token 58845 [missed opportunity]: Returns to Burnside/inclusion-exclusion again after already seeing that constrained handling remained the unresolved blocker.
- Token 64055 [verification]: Compares unrestricted Burnside totals against constrained brute-force totals on small ranges; mismatch persists.
- Token 70293-81863 [wasted]: Extended second analytic detour (invalid-subtraction and signed-count derivations) without yielding a verified full \(n=1{,}000{,}000\) computation.
- Token 87129 [questionable statement]: Explicitly considers placeholder output despite lacking a computed result.
- Token 87328 [mistake]: Chooses to output a placeholder value.
- Token 87338 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{0}\), which is incorrect.
