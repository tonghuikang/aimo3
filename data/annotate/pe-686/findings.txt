Correct answer: 77593

Correct approach
- Let \(\alpha = \log_{10}(2)\). For a 3-digit prefix \(L=123\), define
  - \(a = \log_{10}(123) - 2\)
  - \(b = \log_{10}(124) - 2\)
- Then \(2^j\) starts with 123 iff \(\{j\alpha\} \in [a,b)\).
- Compute \(p(123,n)\) by counting exponents \(j\) with that condition until the count reaches \(n=678910\). An incremental mantissa update \(f \leftarrow (f+\alpha) \bmod 1\) is sufficient and fast enough.
- This gives \(p(123,678910)=193060223\), so
  - \(p(123,678910) \bmod 99991 = 77593\).
- Consistency check: the same condition reproduces the given checkpoint \(p(123,45)=12710\).

Wrong approaches and why they fail
- Treating a rational approximation \(\alpha \approx p/q\) as globally exact and then assuming a strict period-\(q\) residue pattern for hits.
  - This can match short prefixes but drifts from the true irrational-rotation sequence at larger scale.
  - It produced the wrong exponent \(193127894\), hence wrong modulo result \(45273\).
- Assuming the hit-gap sequence must be only \(\lfloor 1/\delta \rfloor,\lceil 1/\delta \rceil\) with \(\delta=b-a\), then forcing a single-offset Beatty-style closed form \(j_n=\lfloor (n+c)/\delta \rfloor\).
  - For this specific rotation/interval placement, empirical checks show multi-gap behavior (e.g., 196/289/485 in the trace) and no globally valid single-offset fit.
- Using unnormalized bounds \([\log_{10}(L),\log_{10}(L+1))\) directly for multi-digit \(L\) instead of subtracting digit length.
  - This mis-specifies the fractional interval and fails even the provided checkpoint.
