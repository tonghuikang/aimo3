## Answer: wrong (45273)

## Key moments
- Token 60 [insight]: The trace correctly reframes leading-digit detection as an interval test on `{j log10(2)}`.
- Token 3011-9302 [wasted]: It spends a long stretch on Beatty/Sturmian/floor-sum derivations without an executable exact method.
- Token 5098 [questionable statement]: It claims the hit gaps should effectively be only `floor(1/Δ)`/`ceil(1/Δ)` for this sequence.
- Token 5402 [mistake]: It starts designing the main computation around that two-gap assumption, which is not valid here.
- Token 10488 [verification]: Directly computed early gaps (`289, 196, 485`) contradict the earlier two-gap premise.
- Token 14736 [insight]: It proposes using a convergent rational approximation (`p/q`) to accelerate counting.
- Token 15403 [questionable statement]: It treats the modular periodic structure from the rational surrogate as if it can stand in for the irrational process globally.
- Token 16401 [mistake]: It asserts the residue-class construction yields exact hit positions, without proving approximation error cannot change membership at scale.
- Token 20433 [verification]: A direct comparison up to `2,000,000` reveals missing hits, showing the residue implementation is not yet reliable.
- Token 21670 [breakthrough]: It fixes the boundary bug (`high_q` off by one), restoring agreement on the tested prefix.
- Token 22089 [questionable statement]: It extrapolates global correctness from this limited prefix agreement.
- Token 22298 [mistake]: It computes `p(123,678910)=193127894` from the unproven global periodic model.
- Token 22461 [missed opportunity]: It validates only small-`n` checkpoints instead of directly validating near the target index or running an exact end-to-end computation.
- Token 24002 [verification]: It re-checks modulo arithmetic on the same incorrect exponent, which does not validate the core model.
- Token 24131 [final answer]: It commits `\boxed{45273}`.
