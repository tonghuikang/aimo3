## Answer: correct (77593)

## Key moments
- Token 35 [insight]: The trace correctly reduces the problem to a fractional-part interval test on `{j log10(2)}`.
- Token 165 [questionable statement]: It uses `[log10(L), log10(L+1))` directly, without normalizing for the digit length of `L`.
- Token 2077 [mistake]: With the wrong interval, the first validation attempt for `p(123,45)` fails (`None`), showing the condition is mis-specified.
- Token 2722 [insight]: It realizes the interval must be shifted to `log10(L/10^{k-1})` and `log10((L+1)/10^{k-1})`.
- Token 2897 [breakthrough]: It rewrites `find_p` with the corrected normalized bounds.
- Token 3043 [verification]: The corrected code returns `12710` for `p(123,45)`, matching the given checkpoint.
- Token 3749 [questionable statement]: It asserts successive hit gaps should be only `floor(1/λ)` or `ceil(1/λ)` for this sequence.
- Token 4529 [mistake]: It builds `p = 90 + 284N + t` from that unsupported two-gap assumption, which is not established for this setup.
- Token 5455 [missed opportunity]: Instead of immediately using the now-correct membership test at scale, it keeps expanding uncertain rotation/Beatty derivations.
- Token 7412-8445 [wasted]: A long discrepancy/Sturmian detour is explored without producing a reliable computation path to `p(123,678910)`.
- Token 10632 [missed opportunity]: It continues extended numerical-precision discussion before attempting the direct large-`n` run that is already feasible.
- Token 15665 [questionable statement]: It revisits a simple constant-offset formula `p(L,n)=floor(n/λ+τ)` as if it might be globally exact.
- Token 15885 [mistake]: Comparing `n=45` and `n=1` shows the constant-offset model is inconsistent, so that shortcut is invalid.
- Token 18768 [insight]: It recognizes that a direct incremental simulation to ~`2e8` iterations is practical here.
- Token 18956 [breakthrough]: It implements `p_of_n_brutal` and directly computes the target exponent.
- Token 19509 [verification]: It verifies the computed `j` has exactly `678910` hits up to that point.
- Token 21216 [verification]: A second independent loop (`p_of_n_brutal2`) reproduces the same exponent, reducing implementation-risk.
- Token 21615 [final answer]: It commits `\boxed{77593}`.
