## Answer: correct (77593)

## Key moments
- Token 83 [insight]: The trace correctly reduces the problem to a fractional-part interval condition on `{j log10(2)}`.
- Token 1479 [questionable statement]: It asserts the hit gaps should be only `floor(1/Δ)`/`ceil(1/Δ)` (about `284/285`) for this sequence.
- Token 3713 [mistake]: It operationalizes that assumption and starts modeling the sequence with the wrong gap structure.
- Token 3827 [questionable statement]: It proposes a global linear-offset model `j_n = floor((n+θ)/δ)` as if one constant offset should fit all `n`.
- Token 4863 [mistake]: It tries to calibrate that offset from `p(123,45)=12710`, which is not globally valid.
- Token 6027 [verification]: It checks interval consistency for a single `β` and finds no non-empty intersection, falsifying the constant-offset model.
- Token 9190 [missed opportunity]: After ruling out the simple formula, it still spends a long time on abstract Beatty/Sturmian speculation instead of pivoting to a direct computable recurrence.
- Token 7993-23858 [wasted]: Extended theoretical detours and side experiments consume a large span before a stable executable method appears.
- Token 12496 [verification]: High-precision checks confirm actual early gaps are `196/289/485`, reinforcing that the earlier `284/285` assumption was wrong.
- Token 18290 [insight]: It explicitly abandons the flawed return-time intuition and restarts from first principles, setting up the later dual-variable derivation.
- Token 24627 [insight]: It derives the useful dual condition in `m`-space (`{(a+m)/α}` threshold test), which exposes a practical way to iterate hits.
- Token 30268 [breakthrough]: It implements `compute_p_by_m`, reducing runtime to a few seconds and directly obtaining `p(123,678910)=193060223`.
- Token 31390 [verification]: Decimal-based validation confirms the computed target exponent starts with `123` and the previous exponent does not.
- Token 33272 [verification]: Independent brute-force checks at `n=1000` and `n=10000` match the fast method.
- Token 33513 [final answer]: It commits `\boxed{77593}`.
