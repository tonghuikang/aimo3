## Answer: correct (53375)

## Key moments
- Token 626 [insight]: Converts the condition into an antichain problem on exponent pairs \((i,j)\), which is the core structural reduction.
- Token 1442-2204 [wasted]: Extended order-ideal / path-count discussion estimates antichain volume but does not directly compute \(P(n)\) values.
- Token 2316 [missed opportunity]: Notes that sums are bounded by \(10^6\), but does not immediately commit to direct bounded enumeration.
- Token 5143 [questionable statement]: Floats the idea that prime counts might often be near \(\{0,1\}\), without evidence from broader computation.
- Token 5541 [mistake]: Over-generalizes from tiny examples that early primes are mostly unique-case partitions, despite already having a known multi-partition prime case.
- Token 5706 [insight]: States the exact constructive form of valid sets: increasing \(i\) with strictly decreasing \(j\), enabling a clean recursive generator.
- Token 8974 [breakthrough]: Implements `count_partitions(limit)` with pruning on partial sums and obtains full counts up to \(10^6\).
- Token 9826 [verification]: Validates the method on known checks \(P(11)=2\) and \(P(17)=1\).
- Token 11700 [verification]: Reproduces the prompt benchmark \(\sum_{q<100,\,P(q)=1}=233\), strengthening confidence in correctness.
- Token 12869 [final answer]: Finalizes \(\boxed{53375}\) after modulo verification.
