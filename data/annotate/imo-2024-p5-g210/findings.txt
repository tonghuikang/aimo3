Correct answer: g(210) = 621.

Key lemma for this family:
- For k >= 4, f(k) = 3.

Proof of lemma (complete):

Lower bound f(k) >= 3:
- Assume a strategy claims guaranteed success in at most 2 attempts.
- In attempt 1, let c be the first column where Turbo enters row 2.
  - Place the row-2 monster at (row 2, c), so attempt 1 fails there.
- In attempt 2, Turbo must enter row 3 at some column d to have any chance to reach the bottom.
  - Because row 2, column c is blocked, d != c.
  - Place the row-3 monster at (row 3, d), so attempt 2 fails when entering row 3.
- Fill remaining interior rows with monsters in distinct unused columns (always possible: rows left = k-2, columns left = k-1).
- Therefore 2 attempts cannot guarantee success.

Upper bound f(k) <= 3:
- Attempt 1: go straight down some column A.
  - If no monster, win.
  - Else discover (rA, A).
- Attempt 2: go straight down a different column B.
  - If no monster, win.
  - Else discover (rB, B), with rA != rB and A != B.
- Then:
  - A is safe in all interior rows except rA.
  - B is safe in all interior rows except rB.
- Attempt 3 construction:
  - If |rA-rB| >= 2, switch between A and B on an intermediate row where both are safe.
  - If |rA-rB| = 1, use a bridge column C not in {A, B}; this exists since k+1 >= 5.
  - This gives a guaranteed top-to-bottom route avoiding the two known blocked cells.
- Hence 3 attempts always suffice.

So f(k) = 3 for every k >= 4.

Compute g(210):
- g(210) = sum_{k=4}^{210} f(k) = sum_{k=4}^{210} 3
- Number of terms = 210-4+1 = 207
- g(210) = 3 * 207 = 621.

Wrong approach to reject:
- "Need to identify all monster columns first, so f(k)=k+1."
- Why wrong: full column elimination is unnecessary; two discovered monster columns already force a guaranteed third-attempt route.
