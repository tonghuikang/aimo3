## Answer: wrong (22356)

## Key moments
- Token 898 [insight]: Correctly identifies the structural simplification that one column is completely monster-free.
- Token 1039 [insight]: Notes that a failed attempt reveals at most one monster, which is an important information-rate constraint.
- Token 2722 [questionable statement]: Treats guaranteed success as requiring certainty that one column is safe across all unknown rows, effectively pushing toward "must find all monster columns."
- Token 3442 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly considers whether adaptive non-straight paths could beat `k+1`, but does not analyze the key consequence that a discovered monster column is safe in every other row.
- Token 4894 [verification]: Builds an upper-bound strategy (`k` failures to reveal blocked columns, then one success), establishing `f(k) <= k+1`.
- Token 5198-5804 [wasted]: Long loop rehashing whether unknown monsters can be bypassed, without adding a new discriminating argument against earlier assumptions.
- Token 6106 [mistake]: Converts the earlier assumption into the decisive but incorrect lower bound `f(k) >= k+1`, locking in the wrong model.
- Token 7206 [verification]: Arithmetic for `g(210)` is internally consistent under that model (`44712/2 = 22356`).
- Token 7396 [final answer]: Commits to `\\boxed{22356}`, which is incorrect.
