## Answer: wrong (22356)

## Key moments
- Token 970 [insight]: Correctly identifies that exactly one column is monster-free and a full descent in that column would win.
- Token 1181 [questionable statement]: Frames the objective as testing columns until the empty one is found, implicitly assuming that route is necessary for a guaranteed win.
- Token 2210 [mistake]: Converts that assumption into the claim that Turbo must effectively see all `k` monster columns before certainty, leading to `f(k)=k+1`.
- Token 3234 [missed opportunity]: Briefly raises the possibility of non-column detours/zigzag strategies, but dismisses them without analyzing whether known monster columns can be reused as guaranteed-safe columns in other rows.
- Token 3503-5921 [wasted]: Repeats the same elimination-based lower-bound argument with minor variations, adding length but no new decisive information.
- Token 6170 [verification]: Attempts a small-`k` sanity check (`k=4`) but treats the conclusion as "probably trivial" instead of stress-testing the core assumption.
- Token 6660 [verification]: Reasserts `f(k)=k+1` after another consistency pass ("one failed attempt eliminates one column"), still within the same flawed model.
- Token 7109 [verification]: Computes `g(210)=22356` correctly from the assumed formula, so arithmetic is consistent even though the premise is wrong.
- Token 7209 [final answer]: Commits to `\\boxed{22356}`, which is incorrect.
