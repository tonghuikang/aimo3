## Answer: correct (57787)

## Key moments
- Token 49 [insight]: Correctly frames s(n) as a max over prime-power requirements via Legendre valuations.
- Token 617 [breakthrough]: Uses threshold counting (`s(i) >= k`) to rewrite S(N) as a cumulative counting problem.
- Token 1157 [questionable statement]: Suggests D(k) may saturate once k reaches s(N), implicitly conflating `N | k!` with `i | k!` for all i<=N.
- Token 2302-11485 [wasted]: Long chain of equivalent algebraic rewrites (D/G/M identities) that does not create a computable path.
- Token 11485 [missed opportunity]: Continues hunting symbolic closed forms instead of switching earlier to a testable algorithm.
- Token 16754-21875 [wasted]: Extended attempt to force closed forms for `s(p^a)` and recall literature instead of executing a scalable method.
- Token 21875 [missed opportunity]: Overestimates runtime risk and postpones direct full-range computation.
- Token 26661 [insight]: Proposes segmented block factorization with small primes plus residual large-prime handling.
- Token 27545 [breakthrough]: Implements `compute_S_mod` with block processing and establishes practical performance scaling.
- Token 32256 [missed opportunity]: Briefly assumes 1e8 may be infeasible under execution limits, delaying the decisive run.
- Token 37154 [verification]: Re-checks interpretation details (sum from i=2..N) and confirms sample S(100)=2012.
- Token 37240 [verification]: Completes full N=10^8 computation (~48.6s) and obtains 57787.
- Token 37258 [questionable statement]: Assumes the brute-force comparator helper returns a scalar directly.
- Token 37344 [mistake]: Verification helper uses list modulo int, producing a TypeError and invalidating that check attempt.
- Token 37365 [insight]: Quickly identifies the helper bug from traceback and adjusts verification logic.
- Token 37524 [breakthrough]: Fixes the brute checker; cross-checks at N=1000 and N=2000 match the segmented result.
- Token 37657 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{57787}`.
