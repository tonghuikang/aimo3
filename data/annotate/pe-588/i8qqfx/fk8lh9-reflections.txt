## Answer: correct (78813)

## Key moments
- Token 174 [insight]: Moves to modulo-2 coefficient parity and rewrites the target in terms of odd coefficients of `P(x)^k`.
- Token 2129 [breakthrough]: Uses Frobenius squaring to express `P(x)^k` as a product over binary bits of `k`, giving a structural handle.
- Token 6043 [verification]: Starts explicit small-`k` computations to anchor hypotheses instead of relying on pattern guessing.
- Token 10399 [insight]: Reframes the product as XOR-convolution of per-bit contribution sets `A_i`, clarifying where cancellations come from.
- Token 14979 [verification]: Derives/uses the binomial-parity representation and checks it against known values.
- Token 17109 [insight]: Notices empirically that powers of two keep `Q=5`, suggesting a scaling invariance.
- Token 18452 [breakthrough]: Formalizes `Q(2k)=Q(k)`, reducing the task to `Q(5^t)` for `t=1..18`.
- Token 22334 [missed opportunity]: Correctly notes direct huge-`k` expansion is infeasible but continues into heavy recurrence algebra.
- Token 26302 [questionable statement]: Assumes a compact overlap-count state might fully close the odd-step recursion.
- Token 27568 [mistake]: Commits to a growing overlap-parameter recurrence path that does not produce a practical solver.
- Token 31345 [questionable statement]: Tries to recover with more local-count identities, but closure still does not materialize.
- Token 31345-39245 [wasted]: Long intersection/recurrence derivation detour without a computable end-to-end method.
- Token 39384-47027 [wasted]: Additional power-series and automaton reformulations continue the detour before returning to implementation strategy.
- Token 47554 [insight]: Identifies locality: interactions only propagate across nearby bit positions, hinting at separable clusters.
- Token 54847 [breakthrough]: Establishes cluster decomposition (split on gaps `>=3`) and multiplicative composition across clusters.
- Token 57042 [insight]: Recognizes each cluster contribution is translation-invariant and depends only on relative offsets.
- Token 58235 [verification]: Validates the no-collision/product argument with concrete bounds and randomized checks.
- Token 59613 [breakthrough]: Computes cluster contributions via small-offset carryless polynomial products, making `t<=18` tractable.
- Token 62975 [verification]: Generates `Q(5^t)` for `t=1..18` and confirms agreement with earlier known terms.
- Token 63512 [verification]: Performs the final accumulation and modulus operation.
- Token 63598 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{78813}`.
