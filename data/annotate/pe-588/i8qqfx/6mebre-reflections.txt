## Answer: wrong (99362)

## Key moments
- Token 144 [insight]: Correctly reframes coefficients as parity of restricted compositions into digits `0..4`.
- Token 381 [insight]: Connects the task to Lucas-style mod-2 structure rather than raw coefficient magnitudes.
- Token 5155 [breakthrough]: Derives the key oddness test `binom((k-1)+b,b)` odd iff `((k-1) & b)==0`.
- Token 6082 [insight]: Converts the coefficient parity problem into a product of subset-choice factors over binary positions.
- Token 8106 [verification]: Confirms baseline known values (`Q(10)=17`, `Q(100)=35`) by direct computation.
- Token 15706 [questionable statement]: Leans on a subset-sum view that underestimates collision/cancellation complexity.
- Token 21112-28839 [wasted]: Long detour on sparse subset-sum enumeration ideas without a scalable path for `10^18`.
- Token 28839 [wasted]: Additional infinite-series/truncation reformulations still do not yield a tractable computation plan.
- Token 37302 [missed opportunity]: After generating many small/medium values, does not lock a validated extrapolation method.
- Token 45780 [insight]: Pivots to parity-recursion structure (`Q(2m)`/`Q(2m+1)`) instead of direct huge-set enumeration.
- Token 50305 [insight]: Builds the framework that odd-case counts require extra local correlation statistics.
- Token 56558 [breakthrough]: Derives `Q(2m+1)=4Q(m)-2-2(P2+P3)`, a substantial structural reduction.
- Token 61934 [questionable statement]: Assumes low-order local-window terms are enough to propagate `P2+P3` reliably.
- Token 66355 [mistake]: The proposed `P2+P3` evolution gives a wrong check (`Q(11)=24` vs true `19`), invalidating that route.
- Token 73982-83566 [wasted]: Extended algebra/performance experimentation continues without restoring a correct full method.
- Token 83566 [verification]: Recomputes exact `Q(5^e)` values through mid-range `e` as a consistency anchor before extrapolation.
- Token 89665-93948 [wasted]: Escalates into higher-order window-transform machinery but never reaches an implemented validator.
- Token 96082 [questionable statement]: Fits a Berlekamp–Massey recurrence mod `99991` from only the first 8 terms.
- Token 96872 [mistake]: Treats that short fitted recurrence as globally valid and extrapolates `e=9..18`.
- Token 97609 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly notes the need to verify `e=9` directly, then skips that verification.
- Token 97915 [mistake]: Commits to `99362` despite unresolved recurrence validity.
- Token 97927 [final answer]: Outputs `99362`.
