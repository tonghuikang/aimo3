## Answer: correct (78813)

## Key moments
- Token 2437 [insight]: Switches from pure speculation to executable parity computations for small `Q(k)`, creating empirical anchors.
- Token 5520 [breakthrough]: Uses Frobenius squaring over `GF(2)` to explain why `Q(2^n)=5`.
- Token 6042 [insight]: Tests the scaling behavior on examples and supports the odd-part invariance claim.
- Token 11426 [breakthrough]: Formalizes the main reduction `Q(10^k)=Q(5^k)`.
- Token 19564 [questionable statement]: Proposes a run-length-only factorization, which ignores internal zero-pattern effects inside clusters.
- Token 20212 [mistake]: Finds the counterexample `n=101` (`Q(5)=17` vs `f(3)=19`), showing the run-length-only rule is incorrect.
- Token 22351 [insight]: Reframes decomposition by interaction gaps and starts measuring real block structure of `5^k`.
- Token 26324-32307 [wasted]: Extended automaton/closed-form speculation without producing a computable pipeline.
- Token 32351-38347 [wasted]: More recurrence-fitting and heuristic pattern chasing continues without actionable progress.
- Token 39377-44322 [wasted]: A long uniqueness/representation detour adds theory but does not directly advance implementation.
- Token 44449 [breakthrough]: Lands the workable cluster rule (group bits with gaps `<=2`, split on gaps `>=3`) and multiplicative composition across clusters.
- Token 46099 [verification]: Checks the separation bound carefully to justify why cross-cluster collisions cannot occur.
- Token 47973 [verification]: Implements `Q_clustered` and matches known small cases.
- Token 49213 [verification]: Runs broader randomized agreement checks against direct computation.
- Token 50935 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{78813}`.
