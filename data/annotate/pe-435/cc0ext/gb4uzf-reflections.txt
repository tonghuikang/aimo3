## Answer: correct (252541322550)

## Key moments
- Token 1107 [insight]: The trace pivots away from irrational Binet arithmetic and proposes deriving a finite-sum identity in terms of `f_n`, `f_{n+1}`, and powers of `x`.
- Token 2029 [breakthrough]: It derives `(1 - x - x^2)S_n(x) = x - f_{n+1}x^{n+1} - f_nx^{n+2}`, which makes each `F_n(x)` computable with fast modular arithmetic.
- Token 2122 [verification]: It checks the derived identity on small `n` cases and confirms consistency with known values.
- Token 2948 [insight]: It recognizes modular division is the key obstacle and suggests computing the numerator modulo `M * |d(x)|` before exact integer division by `d(x)=1-x-x^2`.
- Token 4152 [breakthrough]: It formalizes why dividing `N mod (M|d|)` by `d` still preserves the correct value modulo `M`, enabling a valid implementation path.
- Token 5823-6313 [wasted]: The trace spends a long stretch repeatedly enumerating implementation pitfalls that are already resolved by the proven modular-divisibility argument.
- Token 10448 [verification]: It corrects a flawed exact-sum test assumption and validates the method by matching direct computations modulo `M` on many small `n`.
- Token 12568 [missed opportunity]: After already obtaining the target value, it keeps adding extra confirmations instead of committing earlier.
- Token 13947-15678 [wasted]: It develops a second matrix-recurrence derivation mainly as redundant reassurance rather than necessary progress.
- Token 15967 [final answer]: It commits to `\boxed{252541322550}`.
