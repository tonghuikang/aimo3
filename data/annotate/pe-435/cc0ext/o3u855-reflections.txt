## Answer: correct (252541322550)

## Key moments
- Token 369 [insight]: The trace settles on computing `F_n(x)` separately for each `x` and summing across `x=0..100`, which avoids handling an intractable direct sum over `i`.
- Token 856-1297 [wasted]: It spends a long exploratory segment on `T_i`/power-sum generating-function ideas that do not produce an executable path for `n=10^15`.
- Token 3320 [insight]: It explicitly switches to an augmented recurrence/matrix strategy instead of irrational closed forms.
- Token 3943 [breakthrough]: It derives `p_{n+1} = x p_n + x^2 p_{n-1}` for `p_n = f_n x^n`, turning the nonlinear-looking term into a linear recurrence.
- Token 4250 [insight]: It notes `F_n(x)` is the prefix sum of `p_n`, so the state must track both recurrence terms and cumulative sum.
- Token 4698 [breakthrough]: It finalizes the 3x3 linear transition for `[p_n, p_{n-1}, S_n]`, enabling `O(log n)` matrix exponentiation per `x`.
- Token 5669 [verification]: It validates the matrix method against brute-force values on small `n` and `x`.
- Token 7066 [verification]: It runs the full computation and obtains the target modular value `252541322550`.
- Token 7275 [missed opportunity]: After computing the target result, the trace delays commitment and continues additional confirmations.
- Token 7619-7979 [wasted]: The ending repeats equivalent edge-case and formatting checks without changing the computed result.
- Token 7997 [final answer]: It commits to `\boxed{252541322550}`.
