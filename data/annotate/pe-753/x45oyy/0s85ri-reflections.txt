Trace 0s85ri: CORRECT answer (4714126766770661630)

Summary: This trace derives the formula for F(p) using cubic character sums and Jacobi sums, then computes the sum over all primes < 6,000,000. The approach is mostly clean and efficient.

Key moments:

[breakthrough] Token 0 (lines 1-100): Correctly identifies the case split: for p ≡ 2 (mod 3), cubing is bijective so F(p) = (p-1)(p-2). For p ≡ 1 (mod 3), reduces to counting additive triples in cubic residues H with F(p) = 27 * S(p).

[breakthrough] Token 0 (lines 100-200): Introduces cubic character expansion 1_H(x) = (1 + chi(x) + chi^2(x))/3 and sets up the character sum framework.

[exploration] Lines 200-700: Extensive algebraic derivation of the character sum expansion, computing T_{a,b,c} sums, relating to Gauss sums and Jacobi sums. Uses numerical computation to verify formulas for small primes.

[mistake] Lines 700-1000: Spends significant time trying to find a pattern for S(p)/r = k(p) via trial-and-error with alpha, beta from Jacobi sum representation. The formula k = (p - 3 + 2*Re(J))/9 is initially derived but doesn't give integers - this is because the x=1 correction term is missing.

[breakthrough] Around line 2900: Finds the algorithm to compute (alpha, beta) by solving 4p = d^2 + 27k^2, with alpha ≡ 2 (mod 3) and beta ≡ 0 (mod 3). Derives F(p) = (p-1)*(p + 2*alpha - beta - 8).

[verification] Lines 3050-3090: Validates formula against brute force for primes up to 200, confirms all match.

[computation] Lines 3096-3134: Computes the final sum for all primes < 6,000,000 in ~7.5 seconds, arriving at 4714126766770661630.

Mistakes:
- Some time wasted on pattern-matching k(p) values before deriving the correct character sum formula
- The derivation of the formula from character sums may have had the x=1 correction issue (similar to 639x5k), but this trace seems to bypass it by working directly with the (alpha,beta) representation

Overall: Efficient trace that correctly solves the problem through a combination of algebraic number theory (Eisenstein integers, Jacobi sums) and computational verification.
