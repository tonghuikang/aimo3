## Answer: correct (936203459)

## Key moments
- Token 58 [insight]: Identifies the invariant that each match contributes 2 total points and reframes the goal as counting unlabeled score multisets.
- Token 2496 [questionable statement]: Guesses subset-sum bounds and sufficiency before fully justifying the characterization.
- Token 5591 [insight]: Recasts the problem as an antisymmetric bounded-flow / cut-feasibility model on the complete graph.
- Token 9132 [breakthrough]: Derives the usable score-sequence criterion (sorted prefix sums must satisfy \(\sum_{i=1}^k q_i \ge 2k(k-1)\), with fixed total).
- Token 10513-14762 [wasted]: Long detour through partition/staircase-bijection speculation without producing a computable formula.
- Token 15971 [verification]: Validates the characterization by matching small-n brute force and reproducing \(F(7)=32923\).
- Token 20097-32413 [wasted]: Extended alternate-formulation exploration after a viable DP direction was already available.
- Token 34014 [breakthrough]: Commits to an implementable DP with prefix-sum acceleration (state by length/sum/last value).
- Token 35071 [verification]: Runs the DP and gets \(F(100)=936203459\).
- Token 35536 [questionable statement]: Assumes int64 cumulative sums likely overflow and invalidate the result.
- Token 35574 [mistake]: Treats the computed answer as probably wrong because of that overflow assumption, leading to unnecessary extra work.
- Token 39471 [insight]: Re-checks numeric ranges under modulo and inspects whether cumsum can exceed int64 bounds.
- Token 39779 [breakthrough]: Resolves the overflow concern (entries are already modulo \(10^9+7\), cumulative sums stay safely below int64 limits).
- Token 40749 [verification]: Cross-checks against an object-dtype implementation on smaller n to strengthen confidence.
- Token 41263 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{936203459}\).
