## Answer: correct (936203459)

## Key moments
- Token 2024 [insight]: Reframes the task as a score-sequence problem for a complete graph where each pair splits 4 total points.
- Token 2727 [breakthrough]: Proposes the k-tournament/Landau-style prefix-inequality characterization as the core feasibility test.
- Token 7852 [verification]: Checks the condition against brute-force small n cases and confirms agreement through n=5.
- Token 14203 [questionable statement]: Claims prefix inequalities are equivalent to simple per-index lower bounds, which weakens the feasibility check.
- Token 17425-23619 [wasted]: Long reformulation detour through transformed variables and alternative combinatorial encodings without improving correctness.
- Token 29420 [mistake]: Builds DP from the weakened constraints, which overcounts invalid score sequences.
- Token 33336 [verification]: Detects mismatch versus known values (e.g., n=4 overcount), proving the DP constraints are incomplete.
- Token 34552 [breakthrough]: Correctly reinstates prefix-sum constraints as mandatory during DP transitions.
- Token 39083 [verification]: Confirms the repaired DP matches trusted small-n values before scaling.
- Token 45524 [questionable statement]: Introduces factor confusion while re-deriving transformed inequalities.
- Token 46594 [mistake]: Uses the mis-scaled transformed condition temporarily, causing inconsistent constraint reasoning.
- Token 46890 [insight]: Re-derives the subset lower bound directly from per-pair 4-point conservation.
- Token 47050 [breakthrough]: Lands on the correct transformed constraints for the shifted sequence (including the right prefix floor).
- Token 47463 [verification]: Re-runs corrected DP and matches known checkpoints, including \(F(7)=32923\).
- Token 48352 [insight]: Identifies that prefix-array aggregation over previous values is the key runtime optimization path.
- Token 48791 [breakthrough]: Implements optimized DP (`count_F_dp_opt_e`) that is practical for n=100.
- Token 49584-53338 [wasted]: Continued optimization/theory exploration after a working method already existed.
- Token 53621 [verification]: Computes \(F(100)=936203459\) with the optimized DP.
- Token 53708 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{936203459}\).
