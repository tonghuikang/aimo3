Correct answer
- F(100) mod 1e9+7 = 936203459.

Correct approach
- Model each pair of teams as splitting exactly 4 total points (possible ordered splits 0..4).
- Let scores be sorted nondecreasing: p1 <= p2 <= ... <= pn.
- Feasibility criterion (Landau-style for k=4 generalized tournament scores):
  - Total sum: sum p_i = 2*n*(n-1).
  - Prefix constraints: for every t in [1, n], sum_{i=1}^t p_i >= 2*t*(t-1).
- Count the number of sorted integer sequences satisfying those constraints.
- Efficient counting DP:
  - State by prefix length i, current score sum s, and last score value v.
  - Transition to next v' >= v.
  - Enforce the prefix lower bound at every step.
  - Use prefix sums over the last-score dimension to reduce transitions to O(1) per (i,s,v').
- Validate on small n and the given checkpoint F(7)=32923 before running n=100.

Wrong approaches and why they fail
- Using only monotonicity plus per-index lower bounds (for example p_i >= 2(i-1)) is insufficient.
  - It admits non-realizable sequences because full prefix constraints are stricter.
  - Example invalid sequence for n=4: (0,2,10,12) passes weak bounds but violates the required prefix inequality at t=2.
  - This overcounts (e.g., gives 85 for n=4 instead of 76).
- In transformed-variable derivations, dropping/mis-scaling the factor in prefix constraints leads to wrong inequalities and inconsistent DP counts.
- Performance-only reformulations (without preserving full prefix feasibility constraints) may run fast but compute the wrong count.
