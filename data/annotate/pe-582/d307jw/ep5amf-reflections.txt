## Answer: correct (19903)

## Key moments
- Token 1357 [insight]: Rewrites the equation as `4c^2 = 3(2a+d)^2 + d^2`, setting up a Pell-form transformation instead of direct brute force.
- Token 1998 [breakthrough]: Introduces `s^2 - 3t^2 = d^2` (with `s=2c`, `t=2a+d`), which gives the right infinite-family structure for counting.
- Token 5201-6026 [wasted]: Long class-number/splitting-prime detour that does not directly produce a working counting procedure.
- Token 10645 [questionable statement]: Infers there is exactly one orbit per `d` from small-sample behavior.
- Token 13539 [mistake]: Implements counting with one seed per `d`; this undercounts (`159` vs expected `235` at `n=1000`).
- Token 14410 [insight]: Uses the `T(1000)` mismatch to infer missing primitive seeds/orbits.
- Token 15131 [breakthrough]: Reframes the method to enumerate all primitive seeds for each `d`, then count each orbit.
- Token 24396 [questionable statement]: Uses an overly broad split-prime rule that treats `2` like a `(2e+1)` contributor.
- Token 25780 [mistake]: Applies that rule to claim 3 seeds for `d=2`, contradicting actual orbit evidence.
- Token 26996 [insight]: Notices the explicit `d=2` solution structure does not match the formula prediction.
- Token 27091 [breakthrough]: Corrects the number-theory rule by handling `2` as ramified; seed-count logic becomes consistent.
- Token 30776 [insight]: Final algorithm is stabilized: find all seeds per `d`, iterate Pell recurrences, and aggregate counts up to bound.
- Token 32242 [verification]: Validates the implementation on provided checks (`T(1000)=235`, `T(10^8)=1245`) before extrapolating.
- Token 32379 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{19903}`, which is correct.
