# PE 582 Findings

## Correct answer
- `T(10^100) mod 99991 = 19903`.

## Core reduction
- With the 120-degree angle opposite the longest side `c`, Law of Cosines gives:
  - `c^2 = a^2 + b^2 + ab`.
- Let `d = b-a` (`1 <= d <= 100`) and `b = a+d`:
  - `c^2 = 3a^2 + 3ad + d^2`.
- Standard substitutions (`x = 2a+d`, `y = 2c`) reduce this to Pell-type norm equations over `Q(sqrt(3))`.

## Correct counting approach
- For each fixed difference `d`, solutions come from Pell-type families (not a finite one-off set).
- There can be multiple primitive seed families for the same `d`.
- Generate all primitive seeds for each `d`, then iterate with unit recurrences (equivalently multiplying by `2+sqrt(3)` or parity-preserving variants) until `c > N`.
- Count all valid triangles with `a <= b`, `b-a <= 100`, `c <= N`.
- This method reproduces the checkpoints:
  - `T(1000) = 235`
  - `T(10^8) = 1245`
  - then gives `T(10^100) mod 99991 = 19903`.

## Wrong approaches and why they fail
- **Finite-primitive assumption**:
  - Claiming that for each `d` there are only finitely many primitive solutions and therefore `T(N)` stabilizes.
  - Failure: Pell-type branches produce infinitely many solutions for represented `d`; counts continue to grow with `N`.
- **Incomplete family coverage**:
  - Using only a subset of seed classes / sign-parity branches / diff forms.
  - Failure: systematic undercount, can produce wrong value `1877`.
- **Insufficient verification**:
  - Not re-checking the full pipeline against both provided checkpoints (`1000` and `10^8`) before extrapolating to `10^100`.
