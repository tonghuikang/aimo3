## Answer: correct (2647787126797397063)

## Key moments
- Token 61 [insight]: Reframes the task as solving a quadratic congruence modulo \(p^2\) and identifying the smallest positive lifted root per prime.
- Token 554 [breakthrough]: Uses Hensel lifting (\(f'(n_0)\not\equiv 0\pmod p\)) to reduce the existence/construction problem from modulo \(p^2\) to roots modulo \(p\).
- Token 1605 [questionable statement]: While handling \(p=13\), the manual expansion is uncertain ("Wait compute precisely"), creating risk in the singular-case conclusion.
- Token 1937 [verification]: Brute-force check over modulo \(13^2\) is run, confirming there are no roots and validating \(R(13)=0\).
- Token 2044 [insight]: Recognizes quadratic reciprocity can convert the Legendre test into a residue-class filter modulo 13.
- Token 2253 [breakthrough]: Applies quadratic reciprocity to characterize contributing primes via residues mod 13 (\(\{1,3,4,9,10,12\}\)).
- Token 3675 [missed opportunity]: Considers searching for a closed-form pattern instead of directly executing the already-available sieve + lift computation path.
- Token 8846 [insight]: Explicitly flags the need for boundary and special-prime checks before finalizing the numeric result.
- Token 8905 [questionable statement]: Momentary boundary confusion appears by mentioning \(p=10{,}000{,}019\) in the inclusion check.
- Token 8928 [mistake]: The boundary check briefly drifts off target before re-centering on primes \(\le 10^7\).
- Token 9094 [breakthrough]: Switches from ad-hoc checking to a clearer validation strategy (independent re-checks and structural justification of the two-lift minimum).
- Token 10574-11255 [wasted]: Extra spot-checks on individual primes after the main sum and earlier consistency checks add little new confidence.
- Token 12094 [verification]: Executes randomized verification of congruence satisfaction and minimal-root selection logic.
- Token 12311 [final answer]: Commits the boxed final value \(2647787126797397063\), matching the correct result.
