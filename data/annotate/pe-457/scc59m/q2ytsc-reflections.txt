## Answer: correct (2647787126797397063)

## Key moments
- Token 126 [insight]: Identifies the problem as a quadratic congruence modulo \(p^2\) and correctly centers the discriminant \(13\) as the key solvability driver.
- Token 572 [breakthrough]: Connects solvability to Legendre/Hensel structure (simple roots for \(p\neq 13\), special handling for \(p=13\)).
- Token 1510 [questionable statement]: Starts inferring strong size conclusions from \(r_1+r_2\equiv 3 \pmod{p^2}\) ("minimal is at most 3"), which is not justified.
- Token 1510-2065 [wasted]: Extended detour on root-size heuristics does not materially help compute \(R(p)\).
- Token 1826 [mistake]: Pushes the same flawed size intuition further, spending effort on impossible tiny-root scenarios instead of direct lifting/computation.
- Token 2424 [insight]: Returns to a constructive route (root mod \(p\) + Hensel lift), replacing the earlier non-productive root-size speculation.
- Token 4329 [verification]: Brute-force check for \(p=13\) confirms no solution modulo \(13^2\), validating \(R(13)=0\).
- Token 5300 [breakthrough]: Uses quadratic reciprocity to reduce filtering to residues \(p\bmod 13\in\{1,3,4,9,10,12\}\), simplifying large-scale computation.
- Token 9530 [missed opportunity]: Performs additional concern checks on Tonelli-Shanks behavior after multiple earlier validations already established correctness.
- Token 10134 [verification]: Runs systematic root-validity checks across many primes to confirm lifted roots satisfy the congruence.
- Token 10722 [final answer]: Commits \(\boxed{2647787126797397063}\), which matches the correct value.
