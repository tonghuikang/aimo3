## Answer: correct (227429102)

## Key moments
- Token 105 [insight]: Formalizes the single-pile Grundy recursion with subtraction and split-XOR moves.
- Token 1215 [breakthrough]: Derives the parity decomposition `x_i = p_i + 2e_i`, giving the stars-and-bars weight for each parity pattern.
- Token 1900 [insight]: Rewrites the target as `S(N,m)=sum A_s * C(N+(m-s)/2-1,(m-s)/2)` where `A_s` counts XOR-zero subsets of size `s`.
- Token 7280 [insight]: Clarifies the split term as a full partition XOR set, aligning the computational recurrence.
- Token 10530 [questionable statement]: Starts assuming large-`n` split XOR saturation might make mex behavior trivial.
- Token 14279 [missed opportunity]: Tests only small fixed periods and does not immediately expand to larger period searches.
- Token 19417-24624 [wasted]: Extended detour into heavy convolution/FFT constructions that are ultimately not used.
- Token 26533-32179 [wasted]: Keeps expanding alternative high-cost constructions instead of switching to period-based counting.
- Token 32179-32465 [wasted]: Continues with divide-and-conquer convolution planning without reaching an executable counting path.
- Token 37526 [questionable statement]: Restricts periodic checks to very small candidate periods for split masks.
- Token 37757 [mistake]: Concludes periodicity is unreliable from that narrow check, which is later contradicted.
- Token 42734 [insight]: Identifies a candidate global period by combining observed component periods.
- Token 43172 [breakthrough]: Establishes eventual periodicity (`start=322`, `period=11060`), enabling direct large-`N` frequency counting.
- Token 46860 [verification]: Implements the finalized periodic-frequency plus DP pipeline and runs sample validation.
- Token 49415 [verification]: Confirms the `N=124,m=9` sample modulo `912491249` matches the provided exact value.
- Token 49578 [verification]: Checks reconstructed large-`N` frequency totals sum exactly to `N`.
- Token 49710 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{227429102}`, which is correct.
