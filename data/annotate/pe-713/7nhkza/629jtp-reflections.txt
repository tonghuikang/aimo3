## Answer: correct (99973)

## Key moments
- Token 1094 [questionable statement]: Proposes a pivot-elimination bound \(D(2N-D-1)/2+1\) as if it might characterize \(T(N,m)\), which bakes in an over-aggressive elimination model.
- Token 1742 [mistake]: Plugging that bound into \(N=8,m=4\) gives 23, contradicting the provided value 7; the model is not the right one.
- Token 3669 [missed opportunity]: Starts pattern-guessing formulas (for example log-based forms) instead of formalizing the adversarial constraint as a graph property.
- Token 3929-7894 [wasted]: Extended detour through ad-hoc formulas, loose information-theoretic guesses, and brute-force ideas without a proof-ready structure for \(T(N,m)\).
- Token 7446 [insight]: Reframes the task as choosing tested edges so every size-\(m\) good-set is forced to contain a tested edge (equivalently, no independent set of size \(m\)).
- Token 8118 [breakthrough]: Connects the edge-minimization objective to Turan extremal structure via complement graphs, yielding \(T(N,m)=\binom{N}{2}-\mathrm{ex}(N,K_m)\).
- Token 9044 [verification]: Verifies the formula on \(T(8,4)=7\), matching the sample.
- Token 12420 [verification]: Implements the summation and checks \(L(1000)=3281346\), confirming the derived closed form.
- Token 13744 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{99973}\).
