## Answer: correct (99973)

## Key moments
- Token 1579 [insight]: Recasts the process as querying edges to hit an unknown size-\(m\) good set, moving from procedural testing to a structural adversary formulation.
- Token 2884 [breakthrough]: Identifies the core extremal form: minimize tested edges subject to \(\alpha(G)<m\), which turns the search problem into a graph optimization problem.
- Token 3840 [verification]: Checks the derived Turan-complement formula against \(T(8,4)=7\), matching the sample.
- Token 4937 [questionable statement]: Raises a special-case objection for \(m=N-1\), informally suggesting the formula might undercount required tries.
- Token 5345 [mistake]: The concrete \((\text{bad},g_1),(\text{bad},g_2),(g_1,g_2)\) narrative treats a particular strategy as if it were a lower bound, incorrectly implying \(T(8,7)=3\) instead of the formula value 2.
- Token 5345-6722 [wasted]: Long detour attempting to reconcile that special-case simulation rather than immediately using the established extremal characterization.
- Token 6722 [insight]: Clarifies the exact fail-information invariant: after failed tests, the unknown good set must remain an independent set in the queried-edge graph.
- Token 7495 [breakthrough]: Uses that invariant to resolve the conflict and re-establishes the \(\alpha(G)<m\) criterion as the correct worst-case guarantee condition.
- Token 8458 [verification]: Implements the summation and confirms \(L(1000)=3281346\), validating the full pipeline.
- Token 10767 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{99973}\).
