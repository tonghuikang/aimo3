## Answer: wrong (57993)

## Key moments
- Token 613 [insight]: Reframes the process as querying edges to find one edge inside an unknown size-\(m\) good clique.
- Token 6922 [breakthrough]: Correctly states that after NO-answers, feasible good sets are exactly size-\(m\) independent sets in the queried-edge graph.
- Token 8103 [questionable statement]: Shifts to a stronger/different criterion based on pair-transversal behavior of independent sets, conflating it with the actual success condition.
- Token 9317 [mistake]: Commits to an incorrect extremal target (\(T=E_{\max}+1\) under added transversal constraints), which already conflicts with small sanity checks.
- Token 14058 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly notices that the transversal framing may be off, but does not reset to the simpler \(\alpha(G)<m\) guarantee characterization.
- Token 14859-34803 [wasted]: Very long DP/pattern-mining detour over small \((N,m)\) tables and heuristic formula hunting without a proof-valid global model.
- Token 22831 [questionable statement]: Reintroduces the same wrong objective as “no pair belongs to all independent \(m\)-sets,” treating it as the controlling extremal condition.
- Token 30816 [mistake]: Continues deriving formulas from that misframed objective even after acknowledging adaptivity complications.
- Token 34803 [missed opportunity]: Moves into clause/set-cover analogies but still avoids locking in the correct Turan-complement route.
- Token 43560 [insight]: Returns to a correct extremal lens: NO-answers correspond to adding edges while keeping \(\alpha(G)\ge m\), with explicit Turan-type recognition.
- Token 50011 [missed opportunity]: Abandons that correct direction and goes back to bespoke \(E_{\max}\)/transversal constructions.
- Token 53358 [missed opportunity]: Derived candidate gives \(T(8,4)=19\), contradicting the given \(7\); this should have triggered a full model reset.
- Token 59065 [questionable statement]: Proposes an empirical piecewise formula in \((d,k)\) from tiny-\(N\) observations without proof.
- Token 59933 [mistake]: Promotes that piecewise rule to a general formula for \(T(N,m)\) (with a special \(m=2\) branch).
- Token 61069 [questionable statement]: After computing \(L(1000)=83{,}459{,}746\), starts rationalizing the provided benchmark as possibly wrong.
- Token 61814 [mistake]: Keeps the inconsistent model despite direct contradiction with the given check \(L(1000)=3{,}281{,}346\).
- Token 67090-73327 [wasted]: Extended algebra and speculation to defend the wrong model instead of revisiting the core derivation.
- Token 73365 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{57993}\), which is incorrect.
