# PE 713 - Fuse Testing Problem

## Correct answer
- \(L(10^7) \bmod 99991 = 99973\).

## Correct approach
- Build a graph \(G\) whose edges are pairs that were tested and returned NO.
- The unknown working set \(S\) (with \(|S|=m\)) must stay independent in \(G\) while only NO answers are seen.
- Therefore, worst-case guarantee is reached exactly when \(G\) has no independent set of size \(m\), i.e. \(\alpha(G)<m\).
- So \(T(N,m)\) is the minimum number of edges in an \(N\)-vertex graph with \(\alpha<m\).
- By complement and Turan:
- \(T(N,m)=\binom{N}{2}-\mathrm{ex}(N,K_m)\).
- Let \(p=m-1\), \(a=\lfloor N/p\rfloor\), \(b=N\bmod p\). Then
- \(T(N,m)=b\binom{a+1}{2}+(p-b)\binom{a}{2}\).
- Equivalent form: \(T(N,m)=aN-\frac{p a(a+1)}{2}\).
- Then \(L(N)=\sum_{m=2}^{N}T(N,m)\), and evaluating at \(N=10^7\) gives \(99973\) modulo \(99991\).
- Consistency checks: \(T(3,2)=3\), \(T(8,4)=7\), \(L(1000)=3281346\).

## Wrong approaches and why they fail
- Replacing the objective with pair-transversal or “essential pair” conditions over independent \(m\)-sets changes the game and overconstrains the target.
- Fitting an empirical piecewise rule in \(d=N-m\) and \(k=N-2m+2\) from small \(N\) values is not valid globally.
- The wrong piecewise model predicts \(L(1000)=83459746\), contradicting the provided check \(3281346\); ignoring this contradiction leads to a wrong final result.
- One wrong trace outputs \(57993\), which is incorrect.

## Trace outcomes
- `innmn5`: correct (99973)
- `629jtp`: correct (99973)
- `uu5w95`: wrong (57993)
