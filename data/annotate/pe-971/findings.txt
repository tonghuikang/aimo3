Correct answer: 33626723890930

Problem summary:
For primes \(p\equiv 1\pmod 5\), with \(k=(p+4)/5\), define
\(f(x)=x^k+x\pmod p\).
Let \(C(p)\) be the number of periodic points of \(f\) on \(\mathbb F_p\).
Need \(\sum_{p\le 10^8,\ p\equiv 1\ (5)} C(p)\).

Correct approach:
1. Set \(r=(p-1)/5\), so \(k-1=r\) and for nonzero \(x\):
   \(f(x)=x(1+x^r)\).
2. \(x^r\) always lies in the subgroup \(\mu_5\) of 5th roots of unity. Partition \(\mathbb F_p^*\) into 5 cosets by \(x^r=\omega^i\), each of size \((p-1)/5\).
3. For coset index \(i\), dynamics on indices are
   \(T(i)=i+a_i\pmod 5\), where
   \(\omega^{a_i}=(1+\omega^i)^r\).
4. If an index lies on a cycle of \(T\), then every \(x\) in that coset is periodic under \(f\): after one index-cycle, the multiplier is some \(P\in\mathbb F_p^*\), and \(P\) has finite order, so some repeat returns to \(x\).
5. Therefore
   \(C(p)=1+c(p)\cdot (p-1)/5\),
   where \(c(p)\) is the number of cycle nodes in the 5-node functional graph of \(T\).
6. Compute \(c(p)\) per prime by:
   - finding any primitive 5th root \(\omega\) via trial bases \(a^{(p-1)/5}\),
   - evaluating the 5 values \((1+\omega^i)^r\),
   - building \(T\) and counting cycle nodes.

Wrong approaches and why they fail:
- Wrong exponent identity: using \(k-1=(p-5)/5\) is incorrect. The correct relation is
  \(k-1=(p+4)/5-1=(p-1)/5\).
- Wrong periodicity criterion: requiring \(\prod (u_i+1)=1\) over one index-cycle is too strict.
  Even if that product is not 1, periodicity still holds after multiple cycle traversals because every nonzero field element has finite multiplicative order.
- Wrong subgroup identification: treating \(1+\omega^i\) itself as a 5th root of unity (\(1+\omega^i=\omega^{a_i}\)) is invalid in general.
  The correct object in \(\mu_5\) is \((1+\omega^i)^{(p-1)/5}\).
