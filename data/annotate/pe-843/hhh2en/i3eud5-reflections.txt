## Answer: wrong (1804)

## Key moments
- Token 137 [insight]: starts with small-n simulation checks to anchor the search in observed periods.
- Token 1570 [breakthrough]: identifies the mod-2 linear dynamics \(v_i' = v_{i-1} \oplus v_{i+1}\), the core structural reduction.
- Token 5240 [questionable statement]: assumes periods for a fixed \(n\) are all divisors of one maximal value \(D(n)\) without proving it.
- Token 5389 [mistake]: this assumption gives \(S(6)=9\), directly contradicting the provided \(S(6)=6\).
- Token 7189 [insight]: notices \(n=10\) binary periods are \(\{1,3,6\}\), exposing mismatch with the earlier divisor claim.
- Token 7369 [breakthrough]: corrects to using realized binary periods rather than “all divisors of \(D(n)\)”.
- Token 15172-20510 [wasted]: long pattern-chasing over candidate order formulas (\(2n\pm1\), halving rules, ad-hoc exponents) that gets repeatedly invalidated.
- Token 24034 [questionable statement]: introduces another unsupported closed-form guess for possible period families.
- Token 32242 [questionable statement]: turns a heuristic \(D(d)\) rule into an algorithm before resolving known edge cases.
- Token 35246 [mistake]: generated set fails the \(S(30)\) check, showing the rule is incomplete.
- Token 36052 [breakthrough]: identifies missing period 5 from \(n=17\), recognizing extra proper divisors can be realized.
- Token 42157 [missed opportunity]: proposes rigorous matrix/factorization methods but does not execute one end-to-end.
- Token 50321 [questionable statement]: infers “only extra divisor is 5” from limited random sampling instead of proof.
- Token 55968 [mistake]: after timeout on broader checks, still commits to the unproven “only extra 5” assumption.
- Token 58094 [insight]: catches contradiction at \(d=33\) (rule predicts 1023, observed behavior gives 31), proving overestimation.
- Token 59141 [breakthrough]: refines \(D(d)\) via the \(2^{k/2}\equiv -1 \pmod d\) condition, partially repairing the model.
- Token 65677 [missed opportunity]: explicitly abandons the rigorous factorization approach and returns to heuristic trust.
- Token 66334 [mistake]: computes \(S(100)=1804\) from heuristic period generation without independent validation.
- Token 66992 [final answer]: commits to \(\boxed{1804}\), which is wrong.
