## Answer: correct (41)

## Key moments
- Token 2570 [insight]: It reframes the task as minimizing a multiplier on top of \(M\) via two additional divisors summing to \(c\).
- Token 3817 [breakthrough]: It formalizes the reduced objective \(f(M+c)=M\cdot\min L(a,b)\) with 3-free parts of \(a,b\), giving a computable search target.
- Token 5922 [verification]: A brute-force scan over \(a+b=c\) finds a best value \(L=254051\) inside that reduced model.
- Token 8322 [missed opportunity]: It flags that solutions not explicitly anchored on \(M\) might exist, but keeps pursuing the reduced model for a long stretch.
- Token 13130 [questionable statement]: It effectively asserts that any optimal construction must include divisor \(M\), turning the reduced model into a global claim.
- Token 13375 [mistake]: It concludes \(g(1848374)=254051\) (the 54070 branch), which is wrong.
- Token 13490-14114 [wasted]: Extended checks continue reinforcing the same restricted branch instead of challenging the global assumption.
- Token 21408 [insight]: It opens a new branch with \(\{1,b,D\}\)-style constructions and derives fresh divisibility constraints.
- Token 29963 [verification]: Bounded search over \(d>1\) alternatives returns no early counterexample, serving as partial evidence before the final reframe.
- Token 39639 [insight]: It reparameterizes by odd divisors \(p\mid n\) and minimizes the ratio \(z/p\), enabling direct comparison of feasible structures.
- Token 45054 [breakthrough]: It identifies the \(p=25\), \((1,8,16)\) construction, yielding \(f(n)=(16/25)n\).
- Token 52709 [verification]: Systematic checks across relevant odd divisor candidates confirm no better feasible ratio than \(16/25\) in the examined divisor family.
- Token 60769 [verification]: It confirms the floor perturbation is negligible, so \(g(1848374)=16/25\) exactly.
- Token 62278 [final answer]: It commits to \(\boxed{41}\), which is correct.
