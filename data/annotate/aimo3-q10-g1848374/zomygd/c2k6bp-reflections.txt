## Answer: wrong (54070)

## Key moments
- Token 2915 [insight]: It reframes the construction as choosing a multiplier on top of \(M\), searching for two additional divisors that sum to \(c\).
- Token 3125 [questionable statement]: It treats “minimal \(e\)” as equivalent to the global \(f(M+c)\) objective, without justifying that every optimal construction must be \(M\cdot e\).
- Token 3153 [breakthrough]: It formalizes an optimization over the multiplier \(e\), trying to minimize the scale factor in \(X=M\cdot e\).
- Token 3585 [missed opportunity]: After ruling out \(X<M\), it effectively narrows to \(X\) in the \(M\cdot e\) family and does not reopen broader \(X\ge M\) structures.
- Token 7612 [verification]: It rewrites the internal branch condition as \(c=a(k+1)\), which is a coherent algebraic check inside the chosen model.
- Token 12206 [insight]: It proposes a direct brute-force search for the smallest feasible \(e\), which is a strong check inside its current model.
- Token 13052 [breakthrough]: The search reports \(e=254051\) as minimal in that constrained family, giving a concrete candidate.
- Token 13147 [mistake]: It asserts \(f(M+c)=M\cdot254051\) globally and therefore \(g(c)=254051\), which is false.
- Token 13558-18728 [wasted]: Long follow-up checks repeatedly validate the same restricted model instead of challenging the key global assumption.
- Token 18618 [verification]: It verifies no smaller \(e\) exists below 254051 in the brute-force scan, but this only confirms the constrained branch.
- Token 19144 [final answer]: It commits to \(\boxed{54070}\), which is incorrect.
