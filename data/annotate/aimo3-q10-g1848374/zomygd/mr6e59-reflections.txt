## Answer: correct (41)

## Key moments
- Token 675 [insight]: The trace pivots from raw divisor guessing to an optimization viewpoint over divisor triples.
- Token 812 [breakthrough]: It states the key reduction \(f(n)=\min\operatorname{lcm}(a,b,c)\) over distinct \(a+b+c=n\), giving a workable global objective.
- Token 4966 [verification]: It derives the \(6n/11\) lower-bound idea from the largest proper-divisor sums, setting a meaningful baseline.
- Token 10742 [missed opportunity]: After establishing \(n\not\equiv0\pmod{11}\), it does not immediately enforce the stricter integrality constraints and continues broad casework.
- Token 15030 [insight]: It parameterizes candidates via \((x,y)\) with \(L = nxy/(xy+x+y)\), creating a systematic search structure.
- Token 21142 [breakthrough]: It sharpens the modular condition to divisibility of the reduced denominator by \(c+1=1848375\), enabling targeted pair filtering.
- Token 22334 [questionable statement]: It temporarily treats reduced divisibility as enough, before confirming whether the resulting \(L\) is divisible by both chosen \(x,y\).
- Token 30429 [mistake]: It accepts the \((2,6)\) branch and infers \(L=3n/5\), which fails the required divisor-integrality conditions.
- Token 30735 [verification]: It checks \((2,6)\) explicitly and rejects it because the constructed \(L\) is not divisible by the needed factors.
- Token 34381 [insight]: The corrected search identifies \((2,16)\) as a stronger feasible candidate with better validated structure.
- Token 34727 [breakthrough]: Brute-force comparison on the corrected conditions selects ratio \(16/25\) as best found, leading to \(f(n)=(16/25)n\).
- Token 42313 [verification]: It confirms the floor step is stable (tiny \(c/M\) perturbation and \((16/25)\cdot2025!\in\mathbb{Z}\)), so \(g(1848374)=16/25\).
- Token 44555-45354 [wasted]: Late side-analysis revisits already settled global-minimality concerns without changing the result.
- Token 45664 [final answer]: It commits to \(\boxed{41}\), which is correct.
