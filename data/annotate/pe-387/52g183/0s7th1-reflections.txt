## Answer: correct (35878)

## Key moments
- Token 120 [insight]: Precisely reframes the target condition as primes `p` whose truncation `q = floor(p/10)` is both strong Harshad and right-truncatable, with `q < 10^13`.
- Token 592 [insight]: Identifies that right-truncatable Harshad numbers can be generated recursively from one-digit seeds by appending digits that preserve Harshad divisibility.
- Token 822 [breakthrough]: Commits to the full pipeline: generate RT Harshads, filter strong ones, then append digits `{1,3,7,9}` and primality-test the resulting primes.
- Token 2330 [insight]: Chooses deterministic Miller-Rabin bases valid for 64-bit integers, which is appropriate for values up to `10^14`.
- Token 2589 [breakthrough]: Implements the deterministic primality test and begins executable enumeration instead of further planning.
- Token 3159 [verification]: Checks the generated RT Harshad count under the bound (`<10^13`) to confirm the search space is manageable and being traversed correctly.
- Token 3565 [missed opportunity]: Obtains the full sum/mod result, but does not immediately run the provided `<10000` benchmark check before confidence discussions.
- Token 3651-4330 [wasted]: Spends substantial tokens speculating about remembered Project Euler answers rather than performing direct validation.
- Token 4695 [verification]: Runs the benchmark validation and reproduces the given `90619` sum for `<10000`, strengthening confidence in correctness.
- Token 4997 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{35878}`.
