## Answer: correct (35878)

## Key moments
- Token 29 [insight]: Reframes the target as primes `N = 10H + d` where `H` must be a strong, right-truncatable Harshad number.
- Token 145 [breakthrough]: Locks in prefix-based generation from Harshad numbers instead of brute-forcing all primes below `10^14`.
- Token 637-1112 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch trying to recall Project Euler numbering/known outputs, which does not advance the computation.
- Token 1202 [insight]: Identifies deterministic 64-bit Miller-Rabin as the right primality method for values up to `10^14`.
- Token 1862 [missed opportunity]: Starts a separate helper (`generate_strong_trunc_harshad`) but then discards that path and rewrites logic, adding avoidable churn.
- Token 2270 [breakthrough]: Implements the deterministic Miller-Rabin `is_prime` routine that makes the full search feasible and reliable.
- Token 3134 [verification]: Uses the provided checkpoint (`<10000` sum should be `90619`) to validate the algorithm before the full run.
- Token 3814 [verification]: Executes the `10^14` computation and explicitly reduces the computed total modulo `99991`.
- Token 3933 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{35878}` based on the verified computation.
