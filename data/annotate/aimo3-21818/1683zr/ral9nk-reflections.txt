## Key moments
- Token 81 [breakthrough]: Notes the round scoring as descending powers of two.
- Token 111 [breakthrough]: Interprets totals as binary sums of wins.
- Token 457 [breakthrough]: Observes scores range from 0 to 2^{20}-1 after all rounds.
- Token 610 [breakthrough]: Highlights that each score group stays even-sized for pairing.
- Token 1542 [breakthrough]: Argues each binary pattern appears uniformly after i rounds.
- Token 2058 [breakthrough]: Concludes final scores form a bijection with runners.
