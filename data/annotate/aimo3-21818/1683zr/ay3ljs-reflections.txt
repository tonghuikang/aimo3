## Answer: wrong (62140)

## Key moments
- Token 140 [breakthrough]: Interprets scores as binary representations of round wins.
- Token 347 [breakthrough]: Frames the tournament as a binary/sorting-network style process.
- Token 837 [breakthrough]: Notes the ranking is determined by scores in 0..2^{20}-1.
- Token 1207 [breakthrough]: Argues each binary score appears exactly once (distinct final scores).
- Token 1533 [breakthrough]: Checks the n=2 example to understand score patterns.
- Token 2093 [breakthrough]: Raises the counting question about possible end-orderings.
- Token 3589 [wasted]: Launches extensive Python simulation/debugging of small cases.
- Token 4712 [verification]: Uses detailed simulated round logs to confirm distinct-score behavior.
- Token 5837 [missed opportunity]: Wonders about structural constraints but does not derive them.
- Token 7427 [breakthrough]: Discusses the problem in terms of linear extensions/partial orders.
- Token 8639 [breakthrough]: Returns to the idea that any permutation might be achievable with suitable speeds.
- Token 9209 [breakthrough]: Asserts freedom to choose speeds/pairings makes all permutations reachable.
- Token 10504 [verification]: Brute-forces small n permutations to support the assumption.
- Token 11029 [missed opportunity]: Says the “any permutation” claim needs proof but doesn’t find the dominance condition.
- Token 12307 [breakthrough]: Gives a constructive assignment of binary numbers to realize any ordering.
- Token 12346 [mistake]: Concludes N=(2^{20})! from that assumption.
- Token 12744 [verification]: Computes v5((2^{20})!) via Python.
- Token 12988 [breakthrough]: Takes v5 mod 100,000.
- Token 13812 [mistake]: Reaffirms the factorial count despite earlier doubts.
- Token 14999 [final answer]: Outputs \boxed{62140}.
