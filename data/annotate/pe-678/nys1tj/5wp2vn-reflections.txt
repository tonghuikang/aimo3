## Answer: correct (86236)

## Key moments
- Token 117 [questionable statement]: Starts with growth-rate extrapolation from three samples, which is speculative and not an exact counting method.
- Token 5539 [insight]: Switches to brute-force validation on small `N`, grounding later steps against known checkpoints.
- Token 14119 [breakthrough]: Separates the count into `S(N)` (e=2 part) plus an `extra` term for `e>=3`, which makes the search tractable.
- Token 21273 [verification]: Confirms from small-scale runs that `e>=3` contributions are real but much smaller than `e=2`, validating the split.
- Token 30771 [missed opportunity]: Returns to asymptotic estimation instead of continuing exact counting, which delays convergence.
- Token 40543-42404 [wasted]: Long parameterization detour over broad family forms without a tight, directly computable counting pipeline.
- Token 47014 [missed opportunity]: Acknowledges the need for an exact modulo answer but still spends time in approximation-heavy reasoning before tightening the method.
- Token 54452 [insight]: Refocuses on explicit primitive-pair candidate generation and contribution accounting.
- Token 58174 [questionable statement]: Assumes `D <= N^(1/(e+1))` is a safe completeness bound for `e>=3` contributions.
- Token 63950 [mistake]: Finds a concrete undercount (`30` vs expected `38`), showing the bound was too restrictive.
- Token 64564 [breakthrough]: Identifies that valid contributing `D` values exceed the prior bound and adjusts the search scope accordingly.
- Token 71770 [verification]: Stress-tests larger-`N` extra-contribution runs to confirm the corrected counting path behaves consistently.
- Token 74880 [verification]: Recomputes `S(N)` and `extra`, combines them, and checks the modulo computation path.
- Token 76193 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{86236}`.
