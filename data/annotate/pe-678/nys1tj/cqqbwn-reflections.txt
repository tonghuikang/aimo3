## Answer: wrong (86224)

## Key moments
- Token 58 [insight]: Frames the goal as an exact computation of `F(10^18)` modulo `99991`.
- Token 3279-3323 [wasted]: Spends time on broad growth/formula speculation without a concrete counting mechanism.
- Token 9273 [insight]: Recognizes from small-`N` checks that `e>=3` contributes nonzero mass beyond the `e=2` baseline.
- Token 16629 [breakthrough]: Moves toward a scalable split between the dominant `e=2` path and separate `e>=3` handling.
- Token 25450 [missed opportunity]: Re-enters high-level growth discussion instead of locking the corrected exact pipeline sooner.
- Token 31371 [questionable statement]: Considers simplified counting viewpoints that risk collapsing tuple multiplicities.
- Token 32755 [missed opportunity]: Expands into broad candidate-generation framing before finishing a correctness-tight method.
- Token 42483 [verification]: Implements and checks an algorithm against provided checkpoints.
- Token 48468 [questionable statement]: Assumes integer `(u,v)` enumeration captures all `e>=3` solutions.
- Token 48501 [mistake]: Finds an off-by-5 result at `N=10^7`, disproving that completeness assumption.
- Token 57819 [insight]: Uses set-difference diagnostics to isolate what classes of solutions are missing.
- Token 60934 [breakthrough]: Identifies missing primitive cases where `a/c` and `b/c` are rational rather than integers.
- Token 68077 [verification]: Confirms the `e=3` gap at `N=10^9` by comparing simple enumeration against `count_e3`.
- Token 68422 [questionable statement]: Treats the correction as e=3-specific and leaves `e>=4` on the earlier integer `(u,v)` approach.
- Token 68978 [mistake]: Produces a final total from this partially corrected model, leading to the wrong modulo.
- Token 68990 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{86224}`.
