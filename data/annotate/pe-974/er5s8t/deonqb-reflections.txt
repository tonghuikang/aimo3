## Answer: correct (13310)

## Key moments
- Token 736 [insight]: Recasts the constraints as automaton state tracking (digit-count parity plus modular residues) rather than brute-force generation.
- Token 1271 [breakthrough]: Formalizes ordering as length-first then lexicographic, enabling a count-and-unrank approach.
- Token 2502 [missed opportunity]: Plans matrix-exponentiation/binary-search machinery before checking whether straightforward length-by-length DP is already sufficient.
- Token 2502-3734 [wasted]: Extended setup around generic large-length methods and preliminaries delays running the simpler fixed-state DP pipeline.
- Token 4727 [insight]: Produces concrete per-length counts and recognizes growth is fast enough to localize the target length directly.
- Token 5334 [breakthrough]: Converts `10^16` into an offset within length-29 candidates after cumulative counting.
- Token 6041 [insight]: Derives the exact pre-final state before appending the forced last digit `5`: parity mask `27` and remainder `10`.
- Token 6577 [breakthrough]: Reduces length-29 counting to 28-step automaton paths from start state to `(27,10)`.
- Token 8463 [verification]: Confirms `DP[28][start]` matches the previously computed length-29 total count.
- Token 8994 [insight]: Identifies `DP[remaining-1][next_state]` as the branch-size oracle needed for lexicographic rank selection.
- Token 9402 [breakthrough]: Implements digit-by-digit unranking from DP completion counts to recover the exact target number.
- Token 10030 [verification]: Checks indexing with the anchor `Θ(10^3)=11137955115`.
- Token 11277 [verification]: Confirms boundary behavior with `Θ(1)=1117935`.
- Token 11399 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{13310}`.
