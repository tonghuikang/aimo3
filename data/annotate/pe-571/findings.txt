Correct answer (mod 99991): 84290

Correct approach:
- For a 12-super-pandigital number N, the base-12 representation must contain every digit 0..11.
- The smallest candidates therefore have exactly 12 base-12 digits, so their base-12 digits are a permutation of 0..11 with a nonzero leading digit.
- Enumerate those candidates in increasing numeric order (equivalently lexicographic order of base-12 digits) and test pandigitality in bases 2..12.
- A fast bitmask checker with base-10-first rejection is important for runtime.
- Scanning by leading base-12 digit in ascending order is valid because those value ranges are disjoint; once enough values are found after finishing a lead, larger leads cannot contain smaller numbers.
- In the solved search, valid counts by leading base-12 digit were: lead 2 -> 2 values, lead 3 -> 3, lead 4 -> 1, lead 5 -> 10.
- The 10 smallest 12-super-pandigital numbers are:
  1587937206284, 1674839888205, 2638904175622, 2806980157234, 2816957039424,
  3325871906940, 3863090145827, 3909765781284, 3925260871994, 3960783529164.
- Their sum is 30510390701978, and 30510390701978 mod 99991 = 84290.

Wrong approaches and why they fail:
- Prematurely stopping with the first 10 hits from leading base-12 digit 6 is incorrect because smaller leading digits were not fully checked.
  - That premature set is:
    4502383746179, 4503314298736, 4503691582775, 4638520139297, 4652827303190,
    4657529108936, 4691105273789, 4783970556112, 4826123090745, 4916270583719.
  - Its modulo result is 77790, which is wrong.
- Random sampling / probability heuristics can find valid examples but cannot certify the globally smallest 10, so they are not sufficient for a correct final answer.
- Best-first search over partial permutation nodes without strong pruning spends excessive work on internal nodes and is not a reliable path to the smallest valid complete candidates.
