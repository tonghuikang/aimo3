## Answer: correct (84290)

## Key moments
- Token 267 [insight]: The trace recognizes naive integer-by-integer scanning is infeasible and switches to structured candidate generation.
- Token 1461 [breakthrough]: It reframes the search to base-12-pandigital candidates in increasing order, reducing the problem to ordered permutation testing.
- Token 5858 [questionable statement]: It assumes rough density estimates will yield many early hits, without validating those assumptions.
- Token 6433-6829 [wasted]: Multiple unbounded `find_first_k` implementations are tried and interrupted before producing actionable results.
- Token 8879 [insight]: A bounded 5,000,000-permutation trial gives concrete feedback that valid numbers are much rarer than expected in the early region.
- Token 9393 [mistake]: The trace treats the earlier probability estimate as if it should match observed counts, leading to a faulty expectation about hit frequency.
- Token 9408 [breakthrough]: It pivots to a full exhaustive permutation sweep with strong early pruning (base-11 first, then remaining bases).
- Token 9904 [verification]: The exhaustive run successfully returns the first ten valid 12-super-pandigital numbers in sorted order.
- Token 11075 [verification]: The trace computes the top-10 sum and confirms the modulo result is 84290.
- Token 11318 [final answer]: It commits to `\boxed{84290}`, matching the verified computation.
