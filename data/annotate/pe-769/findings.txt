# Problem pe-769 Findings

## Problem Statement
Count primitive representations (x,y) with gcd(x,y)=1 and x,y>0 of z² by the form f(x,y) = x² + 5xy + 3y² for z ≤ N.
Given: C(10³) = 142, C(10⁶) = 142463. Find C(10¹⁴) mod 99991.

## Correct Answer: 31047

## Correct Reduction and Exact Method
- The form has discriminant 13 and can be written as a norm form in Q(√13): f(x,y)=N(x+yτ), τ=(5+√13)/2.
- After parametrization and parity split, primitive representations reduce to counting coprime pairs (a,b) with:
  - odd-odd case: z = |a²-13b²|/4
  - opposite-parity case: z = |a²-13b²|
- In both cases positivity requires a²-10ab+13b² > 0, equivalently a/b < r1 or a/b > r2, where:
  - r1 = 5 - 2√3
  - r2 = 5 + 2√3
- Primitive condition becomes:
  - gcd(a,b)=1
  - 13 ∤ a
- Therefore C(N) is an exact lattice-count problem with two bounds:
  - |a²-13b²| ≤ 4N for odd-odd
  - |a²-13b²| ≤ N for opposite parity
  and the cone constraint from r1,r2.
- Exact counting is done by iterating b up to O(√N), deriving integer intervals for a from the two inequalities, and enforcing gcd/parity/13 constraints with Möbius inclusion-exclusion.
- A crucial correctness detail is using the exact nonempty-interval b-bounds from the cone/magnitude inequalities (not a looser heuristic cutoff).
- This exact method reproduces both checks C(10³)=142 and C(10⁶)=142463, then gives C(10¹⁴) mod 99991 = 31047.

## Wrong Approaches and Why They Fail
- Linear extrapolation from C(10⁶)/10⁶ (treating near-linearity as exact) gives a wrong modulus.
- Fitting guessed asymptotic constants (e.g., L-value/π-based forms) and using floor(cN) is not an exact counting argument and gives wrong answers.
- Reasoning based only on indefinite-form unit orbits (infinite families) without a correct positive-region/primitive filter leads to inconsistent representation rules.
- Ad hoc prime-type/exponent pattern rules inferred from sparse samples are unstable and contradict further checks.
