## Answer: correct (684724920)

## Key moments
- Token 216 [insight]: Reframes the condition as forced ascents on non-multiples of `k` and at-least-one descent on multiples, setting up descent-set counting.
- Token 651 [questionable statement]: First DP implementation applies one formula path without properly separating `t=0` and `t>0` remainder behavior.
- Token 730 [mistake]: Computed `Q(5)` modulo value (`854991168`) disagrees with the known check (`879391168`), proving the formula is wrong.
- Token 886 [breakthrough]: Introduces `P_dp_correct` with corrected case handling and immediately matches known small examples.
- Token 9534 [insight]: Cleanly parameterizes each `k` case with `b=floor((N-1)/k)` and remainder structure, stabilizing later derivations.
- Token 15292 [missed opportunity]: Returns to several equivalent generating-function rewrites without locking a direct recurrence, which delays progress.
- Token 17122 [questionable statement]: Proposes a recurrence guess with uncertain sign structure before verifying against composition expansions.
- Token 17543 [mistake]: The guessed recurrence sign pattern is shown inconsistent by small-case expansion checks.
- Token 21113 [breakthrough]: Derives the correct recurrence `dp[i] = s_i + Σ s_l dp[i-l]`, equivalent to `D=1/(1-S)`.
- Token 26119 [questionable statement]: Uses a `δ=1` expression summing `ℓ=1..b`, implicitly excluding the `ℓ=0` last-interval case.
- Token 26591 [mistake]: This omission yields the impossible `-1 mod p` outcome for `(n,k)=(3,2)` instead of the verified value `26`.
- Token 27071 [breakthrough]: Identifies the missing `ℓ=0` term (last interval containing only the remainder block).
- Token 29048 [verification]: Implements the corrected `ℓ=0..b` formula in `P_dp_correct` and matches brute-force/small-`N` checks.
- Token 32437 [verification]: Confirms edge behavior (`k=N`) with `P_dp_correct(5,5)=1`, consistent with the monotone-row interpretation.
- Token 38296 [insight]: Re-expresses exact-ascent counting with a superset inclusion-exclusion form `G(S)=Σ_{T⊇S}(-1)^{|T|-|S|}F(T)^N`.
- Token 46221 [wasted]: After multiple transforms (`S_d`, divisor/gcd rewrites), the derivation loops back to the original objective without computational gain.
- Token 55957 [missed opportunity]: Spends a long stretch on probabilistic/covering interpretations of descent patterns that do not yield an executable algorithm.
- Token 60834 [insight]: Pins down a workable numeric strategy: FFT convolution with coefficient splitting to keep rounding safe under large intermediate sums.
- Token 69668 [breakthrough]: Commits to FFT-based modular convolution plus Newton inversion and starts a full working implementation.
- Token 71134 [verification]: Runs small-`N` regression checks successfully before the target computation.
- Token 71235 [verification]: Executes `compute_Q(50000)` with progress checkpoints to validate runtime behavior.
- Token 71735 [final answer]: Commits the final value `Q(50000) mod 1000000123 = 684724920`.
