# PE 489 Findings

## Problem Summary
For fixed `a,b`, define
- `f(n) = n^3 + b`
- `g(n) = (n+a)^3 + b`
- `G(a,b)` = smallest `n >= 0` where `gcd(f(n), g(n))` is maximized.

Then `H(m,n) = sum_{1<=a<=m, 1<=b<=n} G(a,b)`.

## Correct Answer
`H(18,1900) mod 99991 = 47602`.

## Correct Approach
- Reduce the gcd value at fixed `n`:
  - `gcd(f(n), g(n)) = gcd(n^3+b, a(3n^2+3an+a^2))`.
- Use the resultant bound:
  - `Res_n(f,g) = a^3(a^6 + 27b^2)`.
  - For every integer `n`, `gcd(f(n), g(n))` divides this resultant.
  - So the maximum gcd is finite and determined prime-by-prime.
- For each prime `p | a^3(a^6+27b^2)`, compute the largest exponent `e_p` such that there exists `n` with
  - `v_p(n^3+b) >= e_p`, and
  - `v_p(a) + v_p(3n^2+3an+a^2) >= e_p`.
- Find `e_p` by modular lifting (`mod p, p^2, ...`) of feasible residues.
- The maximal gcd is `D = prod p^{e_p}`.
- Compute `G(a,b)` as the smallest non-negative `n` satisfying all local prime-power congruence constraints for `D`; combine local residues with CRT.
- Sum all `G(a,b)` for `1<=a<=18, 1<=b<=1900` and reduce mod `99991`.

## Wrong Approaches And Why They Fail
- Assuming the maximum gcd is unbounded because `a(3n^2+3an+a^2)` grows with `n`:
  - False; gcd values are globally bounded by the resultant.
- Assuming maximum gcd always equals full resultant `a^3(a^6+27b^2)`:
  - False; some prime powers in the resultant are not simultaneously achievable by congruence constraints.
- Inferring a universal formula from ratio patterns (`resultant / max_gcd`) on sampled pairs:
  - Unreliable; local `p`-adic feasibility differs by `(a,b)` and must be checked directly.
- Brute-forcing `n` only up to a fixed cutoff:
  - Can miss the true maximizing `n` and therefore produce wrong `G(a,b)`.

## Validation Targets
A correct implementation reproduces:
- `H(5,5) = 128878`
- `H(10,10) = 32936544`
