## Answer: correct (47602)

## Key moments
- Token 2726 [questionable statement]: The trace suggests the gcd might become arbitrarily large as `n` grows because `aK` grows with `n`, without yet using a global bound.
- Token 4970 [mistake]: It explicitly concludes the maximum gcd may be unbounded as `n -> infinity`, which is a false direction for this problem.
- Token 6152-7039 [wasted]: A long brute-force/search-limit exploration is run to test growth behavior instead of first proving a structural bound.
- Token 8813 [insight]: The trace notices the divisibility constraints look like a common-root/resultant setup for two polynomials.
- Token 9379 [breakthrough]: It states the Bezout/resultant argument (`U(n)A(n)+V(n)B(n)=Res`) to bound every achievable gcd by a fixed integer.
- Token 10349 [verification]: Numerical checks confirm the maximal gcd is often a proper divisor of the resultant, validating that feasibility checks are still required after bounding.
- Token 14565 [missed opportunity]: The trace spends substantial effort pattern-fitting quotient factors (`res_ac` scalings) before switching to a cleaner prime-power solvability approach.
- Token 17917 [insight]: It reframes the task per prime as finding the largest `e` with simultaneous solvability modulo `p^e` via lifting.
- Token 22281 [breakthrough]: It recognizes prime exponents can be combined independently via CRT, giving a constructive path to `d_max` and then minimal `n`.
- Token 24143 [breakthrough]: The symbolic resultant formula `a^3(a^6+27b^2)` is obtained, which makes factor-driven processing explicit.
- Token 28466 [verification]: The derived algorithm is validated against both provided checkpoints `H(5,5)` and `H(10,10)`.
- Token 37286 [verification]: The optimized implementation is cross-checked against the previous solver on random cases before the final full computation.
- Token 38000 [final answer]: The trace commits to `\boxed{47602}`.
