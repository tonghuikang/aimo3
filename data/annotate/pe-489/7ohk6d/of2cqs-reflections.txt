## Answer: correct (47602)

## Key moments
- Token 734 [questionable statement]: The trace raises the possibility that the gcd might be unbounded as `n` increases, before using a fixed arithmetic bound.
- Token 2837 [mistake]: It explicitly considers that the maximizing gcd might be "possibly infinite," which is an incorrect direction for this task.
- Token 2964 [insight]: It pivots to the resultant theorem for polynomial values, recognizing this gives an `n`-independent bound on possible gcd values.
- Token 3948 [breakthrough]: Symbolic computation is used to obtain the explicit resultant structure, turning the argument into a concrete computable bound.
- Token 5758-11862 [wasted]: A long ratio/pattern-hunting detour over sampled pairs consumes many tokens without yielding a stable general method.
- Token 11931 [insight]: The trace reframes the objective prime-by-prime as maximizing local `p`-adic exponents via congruence solvability.
- Token 15245 [breakthrough]: It proposes an exact prime-power lifting algorithm to compute maximal exponents and then reconstruct `G(a,b)` via CRT.
- Token 22961 [breakthrough]: The prime-power + CRT implementation is completed and validated against randomized small-case checks.
- Token 26331 [verification]: A verification mismatch is traced to swapped return-value ordering in the brute-force checker, then corrected.
- Token 26843 [verification]: The algorithm reproduces the provided benchmark `H(5,5)`.
- Token 27415 [missed opportunity]: After correctness is established, substantial time is spent on slower optimization paths before adopting the key residue-generation speedup.
- Token 31085 [insight]: The core bottleneck is identified: scanning all residues modulo large primes at level `e=1` is too expensive.
- Token 33068 [breakthrough]: A faster case-split strategy is introduced (including direct root construction for `p \nmid a`) to avoid exhaustive residue scans.
- Token 38422 [verification]: The optimized solver is run on the full `H(18,1900)` target computation.
- Token 38644 [verification]: Modulo checks against known benchmark arithmetic are explicitly confirmed before finalization.
- Token 38862 [final answer]: The trace commits to `\boxed{47602}`.
