## Correct answer: 9597

## Problem summary
Given M = 3^(2025!), compute g(1848374) + g(44636594) where g(c) = floor(2025! * f(M+c) / M) / 2025!, and f(n) is the smallest n-Norwegian number (has 3 distinct divisors summing to n).

## Correct approach
1. f(n) = min LCM(a,b,c) over distinct positive integers a+b+c = n
2. Key reduction: when a divides c and b divides c (with a,b less than c), LCM(a,b,c) = c. So f(n) = min c such that c has two distinct proper divisors summing to n-c.
3. Writing a = c/x, b = c/y for distinct integers x,y >= 2: c = n*xy/(xy+x+y), ratio r(x,y) = xy/(xy+x+y)
4. Lower bound: r >= 6/11 (at x=2, y=3), but achievability depends on divisibility of n by (xy+x+y)/gcd(xy, xy+x+y)
5. For M = 3^(2025!), M is congruent to 1 mod p for all primes p at most 2025. So N = M+c has N mod p = (1+c) mod p.
6. Systematic search over (x,y) pairs with divisibility constraints yields optimal pairs: (2,16) for c=1848374 with ratio 16/25, and (2,55) for c=44636594 with ratio 110/167.
7. g(c) equals the ratio exactly (since 2025! times the ratio is integer and the correction is negligible). Sum = 16/25 + 110/167 = 5422/4175, p+q = 9597.

## Key wrong approaches
- Restricting to triples containing M (m76ebm, answer 533): Assumes one element must be M itself, then considers triples containing 1, b, N-1-b. Gets g(c) = (p-1)/p where p = smallest odd prime factor of c. This misses the optimal construction where c is near (6/11)N.
- Assuming lower bound 6/11 is always achieved (veyh5s, answer 23): Assumes g(c) = 6/11 for both values without checking divisibility conditions. The (2,3) pair requires 11 divides N which does not hold for these specific c values. Also contains arithmetic error.

## Critical decision points
- Recognizing that f(n) = min c (not min LCM in general) when two elements divide the third
- Parameterizing as (x,y) pairs and deriving the ratio formula
- Checking divisibility constraints for each (x,y) pair given M = 3^(2025!)
- Understanding that M mod p = 1 for small primes, so divisibility depends on c mod p
