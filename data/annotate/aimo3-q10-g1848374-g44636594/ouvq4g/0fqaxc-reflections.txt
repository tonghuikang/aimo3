## Answer: correct (9597)

## Key moments
- Token 1-23 [breakthrough]: Sets up problem correctly, computes f(n) via brute force for small n
- Token 64-282 [mistake]: Initially follows same wrong path as m76ebm - restricts to triples containing M, derives L_min formula, gets 44087
- Token 282-551 [wasted]: Extended work on the L_min approach (wrong)
- Token 551-1060 [wasted]: Multiple reconsiderations - realizes trivial {1,2,N} construction, then realizes g(c) might be 0 or 1, confusion
- Token 1060-1179 [breakthrough]: Discovers the {1, b, N} approach with large b dividing n-1, derives g(c) = (p-1)/p formula
- Token 1179-1506 [mistake]: Commits to (p-1)/p approach, gets intermediate wrong answer 11
- Token 1506-1993 [breakthrough]: Re-examines problem, considers general triples {c/x, c/y, c} where a,b divide c. This is the correct framework.
- Token 1993-2338 [breakthrough]: Implements systematic search over (p,q) pairs, finds optimal (2,16) for c1 and (2,55) for c2
- Token 2338-2486 [final answer]: Computes sum 16/25 + 110/167 = 5422/4175, answer 9597
