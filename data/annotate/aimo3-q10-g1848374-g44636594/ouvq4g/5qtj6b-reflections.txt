## Answer: correct (9597)

## Key moments
- Token 1-35 [breakthrough]: Correctly establishes f(n) = min LCM(a,b,c) over distinct positive integers summing to n
- Token 35-57 [breakthrough]: Key reduction: when two smaller elements divide the largest, LCM = largest element. So f(n) = min c s.t. n-c = sum of two distinct proper divisors of c.
- Token 57-167 [breakthrough]: Derives lower bound f(n) >= 6n/11 via d_max <= 5c/6 analysis
- Token 167-499 [wasted]: Extended exploration of divisibility constraints (modular arithmetic for pairs), but eventually arrives at correct systematic approach
- Token 499-509 [breakthrough]: General formula: for pair (x,y), c = N*xy/(xy+x+y), ratio minimized at (x,y)=(2,3) giving 6/11
- Token 509-639 [breakthrough]: Systematically tests pairs (2,d) for feasibility based on divisibility of N by required factor
- Token 639-774 [mistake]: Incorrectly concludes (2,6) works because it only checks 5|N, not the full 10|N requirement; but self-corrects
- Token 774-899 [breakthrough]: Corrects divisibility analysis - N must be divisible by specific L for each pair, accounting for N being odd
- Token 900-1050 [breakthrough]: Implements comprehensive Python search over (x,y) pairs up to large bounds
- Token 1026-1059 [breakthrough]: Finds optimal pairs: (2,16) for c1 with ratio 16/25, (2,55) for c2 with ratio 110/167
- Token 1197-1219 [breakthrough]: Derives g(c) = ratio p/q via floor analysis, since 2025! * p/q is integer and correction term negligible
- Token 1219-1293 [final answer]: Computes sum 16/25 + 110/167 = 5422/4175, p+q = 9597
- Token 1293-1349 [verification]: Double-checks computation and confirms answer 9597
