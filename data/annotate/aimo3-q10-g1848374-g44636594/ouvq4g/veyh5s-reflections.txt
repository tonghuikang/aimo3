## Answer: wrong (23)

## Key moments
- Token 1-249 [breakthrough]: Establishes f(n) framework and lower bound 6n/11
- Token 249-505 [wasted]: Extended exploration of divisor conditions, modular arithmetic
- Token 505-2055 [mistake]: Explores multiple approaches ({1,b,N} construction, brute force experiments) but never systematically searches over (x,y) pairs with divisibility conditions on N
- Token 2055-2063 [mistake]: Incorrectly assumes g(c) = 6/11 for both c values without verifying that the 6/11 bound is achievable. The actual achievable ratios are 16/25 and 110/167.
- Token 2063-2100 [mistake]: Small-scale experiments show ratio ~0.666, not 0.545, contradicting the claim. Despite this evidence, still commits to 6/11.
- Token 2100-2193 [mistake]: Hand-waves that "for huge N" the ratio approaches 6/11, ignoring that specific N values have different achievable ratios based on divisibility
- Token 2195-2209 [mistake]: Final answer contains arithmetic error: writes g(c1)+g(c2) = 20/11 = 12/11 (20/11 ≠ 12/11), then says p=12, q=11, answer 23
