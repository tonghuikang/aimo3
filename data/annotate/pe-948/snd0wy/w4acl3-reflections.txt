## Answer: correct (64975)

## Key moments
- Token 176 [insight]: Identifies that interpretation of “whether it’s Left or Right” is the core ambiguity and starts resolving it via outcome-class framing.
- Token 176-1344 [wasted]: Prolonged interpretation discussion before committing to a concrete formal target state.
- Token 2449 [breakthrough]: Introduces explicit `DP_left[i][j]` / `DP_right[i][j]` state modeling for substrings and turns.
- Token 6159 [breakthrough]: Correctly maps the target to class `N` (`DP_left[1][n]=true` and `DP_right[1][n]=true`).
- Token 6310 [verification]: Brute-force DP over small `n` reproduces the checkpoints (`F(3)=4`, `F(8)=181`).
- Token 10124 [insight]: Extracts structural distribution facts from data (`L`/`R` symmetry, odd/even behavior of `P`).
- Token 10251 [breakthrough]: Recognizes `P(2k)` as Catalan-indexed (`Catalan_{k-1}`).
- Token 11961 [insight]: Recognizes `L`/`R`-class counts as central binomial families, enabling closed-form assembly.
- Token 13511 [breakthrough]: States closed forms for `F(n)` in odd/even cases from class-count decomposition.
- Token 13865 [questionable statement]: Begins `n=60` substitution quickly, which introduces indexing risk.
- Token 13906 [mistake]: Writes `2*binom(119,29)` instead of the correct `2*binom(59,29)`.
- Token 13935 [breakthrough]: Immediately fixes the index (`2k-1=59`) and restores the correct even-`n` formula.
- Token 14486 [verification]: Tests the closed-form expressions against smaller even/odd values to confirm consistency.
- Token 15041 [verification]: Performs final numeric modular evaluation for `n=60`.
- Token 15286 [final answer]: Commits to `64975`.
