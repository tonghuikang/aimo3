Correct answer: F(60) mod 99991 = 64975.

Correct approach:
Treat each word as a partizan game state with four outcome classes:
- N: first player wins (this is what F(n) counts)
- P: second player wins
- L: Left wins regardless of starter
- R: Right wins regardless of starter

For a word s, define:
- L(s): Left wins if Left is to move
- R(s): Right wins if Right is to move
Then:
- N means L(s)=true and R(s)=true
- P means L(s)=false and R(s)=false
- L-class means (true,false)
- R-class means (false,true)

Using DP on substrings and small-n data, the class counts follow:
- If n=2k+1 (odd):
  - P_n = 0
  - L_n = R_n = C(2k,k)
  - F(n)=N_n = 2^n - 2*C(2k,k)
- If n=2k (even):
  - P_n = Catalan(k-1)
  - L_n = R_n = C(2k-1,k-1)
  - F(n)=N_n = 2^n - 2*C(2k-1,k-1) - Catalan(k-1)

For n=60 (k=30):
- F(60)=2^60 - 2*C(59,29) - Catalan(29)
- Catalan(29)=C(58,29)/30
- Evaluating mod 99991 gives 64975.

Wrong approaches and why they fail:
1. Misreading the target as an OR condition (“starter wins if Left starts OR starter wins if Right starts”).
   - The problem requires N-positions (first player wins regardless of starter identity), not a union of one-sided starts.
   - This interpretation conflicts with the given calibration F(3)=4.

2. Over-simplifying bad-set structure (e.g., assuming disjoint complements, or reducing to a Fibonacci-only subtraction such as 2^n-2*Fib(n)).
   - These miss overlap/intersection terms and proper-prefix/proper-suffix constraints.
   - They fail against small-n checks (notably n=4,6,8).

3. Index-substitution arithmetic slip at n=60 (using C(119,29) instead of C(59,29)).
   - Correct even-n formula uses C(n-1, n/2-1)=C(59,29) when n=60.
