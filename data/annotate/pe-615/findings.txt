## Problem pe-615: Millionth Number with At Least One Million Prime Factors

### Correct Answer
108424772

### Correct Approach
1. Let `N = 10^6`, and write each candidate as
   `n = 2^(N-r) * s`, where `s` is odd and `r = Omega(s)`.
   Equivalently, relative to `2^N`, we rank multipliers in the semigroup generated by:
   - `2` (adds one extra factor of 2), and
   - `p/2` for each odd prime `p` (replace one 2 by `p`).

2. If `M_k` is the `k`-th smallest multiplier in that semigroup (with `M_1 = 1`), then the target is
   `a_N = 2^N * M_N`.

3. Generate the first `N` multipliers with a Hamming/Ugly-number style heap merge.
   Use exact state `(odd, exp)` meaning value `odd * 2^exp` with `odd` odd.
   Transitions are:
   - multiply by `2`: `(odd, exp+1)`
   - multiply by `p/2`: `(odd*p, exp-1)` for odd prime `p`

4. For `M_N = odd * 2^exp`, compute
   `a_N mod MOD = odd * 2^(N+exp) mod 123454321`.

5. Prime cutoff for odd primes must be validated by convergence (increase cutoff until `M_N` and final modulo stop changing). For this problem, the result stabilizes and yields the correct value above.

### Wrong Approaches and Why They Fail
- **Asymptotic/closed-form guessing (`2^N * N^c`, etc.)**:
  Gives scale intuition only; it cannot determine the exact millionth order statistic.

- **Omitting the generator `2`**:
  Enumerates only products of `p/2` and misses valid terms with extra powers of 2. This changes rank order and produces a wrong final modulo (observed wrong output: `34113628`).

- **Using too-small odd-prime cutoff (`pmax`) without stability checks**:
  Misses multipliers that should appear before rank `10^6`, so the result is unstable/wrong (observed provisional wrong output: `47012313`).

- **Risky dedup via modulo-only identity**:
  Distinct states can collide modulo `123454321`; ordering/dedup must use exact value state/comparison logic.
