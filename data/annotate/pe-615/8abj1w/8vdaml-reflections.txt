## Answer: correct (108424772)

## Key moments
- Token 76-7859 [wasted]: Extended heuristic exploration of growth/order behavior without a concrete construction for the ranked sequence.
- Token 7860 [missed opportunity]: Continues pattern chasing instead of committing early to a direct generation/counting algorithm.
- Token 12642 [missed opportunity]: Recognizes that `O(N log N)` might be feasible but still defers implementation for further speculative analysis.
- Token 14322 [questionable statement]: Assumes the correction factor above `2^N` is bounded by a small fixed power-of-two scale without justification.
- Token 18454 [mistake]: Drifts to an unsupported model (`a_N` as a near-closed form like `2^N * floor(N^c)`), which cannot determine the exact ranked term.
- Token 27661 [insight]: Reframes the objective as the Nth smallest product in the multiplier semigroup (`2`, `p/2`) relative to `2^N`.
- Token 28508 [breakthrough]: Formalizes `M_N = s / 2^r` so final modular computation becomes `2^(N-r) * s (mod M)`.
- Token 31575 [insight]: Chooses an exact `(odd, exp)` state representation that supports efficient heap transitions under both `×2` and `×(p/2)`.
- Token 40916 [breakthrough]: Implements the heap-based generator and validates it on small-`N` cases, confirming ordering/indexing behavior.
- Token 42283 [verification]: Benchmarks runtime on large intermediate sizes (100k/500k) to confirm feasibility for `N = 10^6`.
- Token 42480 [verification]: Runs the full computation at `N = 10^6` to obtain an initial candidate under a finite prime cutoff.
- Token 43112 [insight]: Notices scaling behavior indicates the current prime cutoff may be too small for a reliable millionth rank.
- Token 43760 [questionable statement]: Treats the first full-run output as effectively final before proving cutoff sufficiency.
- Token 43799 [mistake]: States the provisional wrong answer `47012313` from an insufficient `pmax`.
- Token 44169 [breakthrough]: Corrects methodology by increasing `pmax` and re-running until the answer stabilizes across larger bounds.
- Token 44424 [verification]: Confirms stability at higher bounds (including 500k), locking the corrected candidate.
- Token 44530 [verification]: Performs an explicit off-by-one/indexing check via the `N=5` sanity alignment.
- Token 44658 [final answer]: Commits to the boxed result `108424772`.
