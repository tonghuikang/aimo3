## Answer: correct (879476477)

## Key moments
- Token 181 [insight]: Recognizes direct iteration over C is impossible and pivots to a per-digit contribution formula.
- Token 340 [breakthrough]: Derives the core substring-sum contribution expression by summing each digit over all start/end pairs.
- Token 730 [verification]: Checks the formula on n=2024 and recomputes contributions to match 2304.
- Token 1109 [insight]: Identifies that C is periodic with period M (digits of P), enabling block-wise summation.
- Token 1368 [breakthrough]: Splits the objective into S = inv9*(A-B), separating weighted geometric part A from linear part B.
- Token 2846 [questionable statement]: Shows uncertainty about the exact closed form for sum_{t=0}^{K-1} t r^t ("???"), which could derail downstream algebra if left unchecked.
- Token 2997-4195 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch on rough prime-size and digit-count estimates that are not needed once direct computation by sieve is available.
- Token 4454 [missed opportunity]: Could have moved immediately to implementation instead of continuing manual sizing discussion.
- Token 7034 [insight]: Commits to direct computation via Python sieve and streaming digit accumulation of M, S0, S1, W0, W1.
- Token 9148 [breakthrough]: Obtains the critical constants (M=7,245,905 and modular aggregates), unlocking final modular series evaluation.
- Token 10734 [verification]: Validates the full method on C(7,3) against brute force and gets exact agreement modulo 10^9+7.
- Token 12297 [final answer]: Commits to 879476477 and boxes it.
