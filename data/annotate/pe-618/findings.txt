Problem: pe-618 - Numbers with Prime Factor Sum

Correct Answer: 634212216

Problem Summary:
- Define S(k) as sum of all n where the sum of prime factors (with multiplicity) of n equals k
- Find last 9 digits of sum_{k=2}^{24} S(F_k) where F_k are Fibonacci numbers

Key Approach (Correct):
1. Define generating function G(x) = product_{p prime} 1/(1 - p*x^p)
2. Coefficient of x^k in G(x) gives S(k)
3. Use DP (unbounded knapsack): dp[0]=1, for each prime p: dp[i] = dp[i] + p*dp[i-p]
4. Compute for all k up to F_24=46368, sum dp[F_k] for k=2..24 mod 10^9
5. Complexity: O(num_primes * maxK) ~ 4800 * 46368 ~ 220M operations

Key Values:
- F_24 = 46368 (max Fibonacci needed)
- Number of primes up to 46368: 4794
- S(2)=2, S(3)=3, S(5)=11, S(8)=49, S(13)=603 (verified)
- Final sum mod 10^9 = 634212216

Wrong Approaches / Pitfalls:
- Treating prime-factor orderings as distinct objects overcounts S(k); coefficients must come from exponent choices per prime (unique factorization), not ordered prime sequences.
- Omitting dp[0]=1 breaks the generating-function identity and loses contributions from single-prime terms.
- Off-by-one Fibonacci indexing (`F_2=1`) can cause summation mistakes; here it is harmless only because `S(1)=0`.

Trace Outcome Notes:
- Both traces use the correct generating-function + unbounded-knapsack DP method and reach the correct final value 634212216.
