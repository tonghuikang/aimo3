## Answer: correct (2677)

## Key moments
- Token 615 [missed opportunity]: It initially overfocuses on special divisor structure of `M` itself (powers of 3) instead of directly minimizing LCM over arbitrary divisor triples.
- Token 5982 [breakthrough]: It correctly reformulates `f(n)` as the minimum `lcm(a,b,c)` over distinct positive `a+b+c=n`.
- Token 14236-21100 [wasted]: A long empirical/theoretical detour is spent re-deriving the global ratio floor before applying it to the two concrete residues.
- Token 21100 [breakthrough]: It crystallizes the key gate: the `6/11` optimum needs divisibility by 11, which the target values fail.
- Token 30048 [breakthrough]: It reduces the search to admissible base patterns with denominator `d=a+x+y` and checks only those `d` dividing `n`.
- Token 35017 [verification]: It sets and executes modular-exponent checks for `3^{2025!} (mod d)` to validate which candidate denominators are feasible.
- Token 42061 [verification]: It cross-checks ratio families against divisor-shape constraints to rule out sub-`16/25` candidates for the first offset.
- Token 49110 [verification]: It expands numeric checks to guard against overlooked lower-ratio patterns.
- Token 54664 [verification]: It explicitly checks small divisors for `n1` and confirms `16/25` remains minimal.
- Token 55603 [verification]: It confirms `30/47` is minimal for `n2` among tested feasible divisor families.
- Token 55638 [final answer]: It commits to `\boxed{2677}`, the correct value.
