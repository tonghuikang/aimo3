## Answer: correct (2677)

## Key moments
- Token 450 [breakthrough]: It shifts from raw guessing to an explicit minimization framework for constructing `f(n)`.
- Token 8033 [missed opportunity]: It leans heavily on `1+d+N` templates early, delaying a cleaner global comparison of divisor families.
- Token 14925 [mistake]: It mixes incompatible lower-bound arguments and temporarily reasons inconsistently about which constructions can beat others.
- Token 24090 [mistake]: It drifts into a smallest-prime-divisor style path for `M+c-1`, which is not the objective needed for the true minimizer.
- Token 32029 [breakthrough]: It returns to the `g(c)` floor expression and reconnects computations to the required scaled ratio form.
- Token 40018-48018 [wasted]: Long small-`K` analogy checks consume tokens without materially changing the final candidate set.
- Token 56018 [breakthrough]: It identifies stronger structured divisor patterns (e.g., `N, N/2, N/4`) and compares their achievable ratios.
- Token 64030 [breakthrough]: It formulates `N = n / (1 + 1/d1 + 1/d2)` and uses it to systematically maximize feasible divisor-sum factors.
- Token 65073 [breakthrough]: It locks in `g(1848374)=16/25` and `g(10162574)=30/47` from the minimal valid parameter choices.
- Token 65793 [verification]: It explicitly checks for missed smaller-divisor configurations before committing.
- Token 66780 [final answer]: It commits to `\boxed{2677}`, which is correct.
