## Answer: correct (2677)

## Key moments
- Token 473 [missed opportunity]: It narrows to the `1+a+N` family too early instead of comparing broader three-divisor LCM constructions.
- Token 1722 [mistake]: It treats the smallest-divisor-of-`n-1` style model as the main route to `f(n)`, which is not globally optimal here.
- Token 7031 [missed opportunity]: It still pursues small-divisor checks instead of switching immediately to the ratio minimization that later succeeds.
- Token 7600-14048 [wasted]: Long parity/divisor-case exploration is spent extending that restricted model before switching frameworks.
- Token 15702 [breakthrough]: It reframes the optimization around minimizing scale ratios from general divisor constructions.
- Token 21067 [breakthrough]: It parameterizes divisors as `N/x, N/y, N` and turns the problem into a clean ratio search.
- Token 28032 [verification]: It checks denominator/parity constraints (like mod-10 feasibility) that eliminate tempting but invalid ratio candidates.
- Token 31616 [breakthrough]: It runs a modular-feasibility search over candidate denominator structures for both offsets.
- Token 38591 [verification]: It confirms the selected minimizing ratios (`16/25` and `30/47`) are feasible for the two `M+c` values.
- Token 43737 [verification]: It explicitly checks the floor perturbation term is negligible (`A*c/M<1`), so `g(c)` stays unchanged.
- Token 43937 [final answer]: It commits to `\boxed{2677}`, which is correct.
