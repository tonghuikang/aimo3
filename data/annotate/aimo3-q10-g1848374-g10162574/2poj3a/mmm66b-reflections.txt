## Answer: wrong (97881)

## Key moments
- Token 489 [breakthrough]: It correctly reframes `f(n)` as minimizing an LCM over triples of distinct positive integers with fixed sum.
- Token 3629 [mistake]: It starts forcing the optimization through a narrowed parameterization that later overconstrains the true minimizer set.
- Token 4992 [breakthrough]: It derives a clean “smallest feasible `t`” heuristic and links it to candidate ratio families.
- Token 14011 [mistake]: It commits to the smallest-divisor-of-`N-1` style model (`t`-based) as if globally valid, which drives the wrong branch.
- Token 21102 [missed opportunity]: Even after failing small-divisor checks, it does not pivot to the better ratio-family approach that yields `16/25` and `30/47`.
- Token 28006 [verification]: It carefully verifies floor perturbation bounds (`epsilon`) but only for values produced by the mistaken structure.
- Token 30912-31332 [wasted]: A long prime-scan/proof attempt is used to defend the wrong minimal-divisor assumption.
- Token 32216 [verification]: It rechecks reduced-fraction arithmetic and modulus consistency internally.
- Token 33710 [final answer]: It commits to `\boxed{97881}`, which is incorrect.
