## Answer: correct (984524441)

## Key moments
- Token 579 [insight]: Frames the stopping-time process with a 2-state pre-absorption Markov view (`last toss T` vs `last toss H`).
- Token 2114 [breakthrough]: Pins down the exact PMF `P(M=k)=F_{k-1}/2^k`, which makes divisibility summation tractable.
- Token 2191 [insight]: Converts the target to `P(n)=\sum_{j>=1}F_{jn-1}/2^{jn}`.
- Token 3549 [verification]: Uses the Fibonacci generating function identity to cross-check the PMF machinery.
- Token 9900 [breakthrough]: Derives the closed rational form `P(n)=\frac{2^nF_{n-1}+(-1)^{n-1}}{2^{2n}-L_n2^n+(-1)^n}`.
- Token 11688 [verification]: Implements modular check for `n=2,3` and matches the given values `66` and `46`.
- Token 13047-15790 [wasted]: Extended roots-of-unity / contour-sum detour that does not feed into the final computation path.
- Token 16056 [questionable statement]: Continues with an algebraic variant before re-running a small-value sanity check.
- Token 16342 [mistake]: The variant produces impossible negative probabilities for small `N`, confirming the algebra branch is wrong.
- Token 16651 [breakthrough]: Restores the correct sign structure in the Binet-series expression and recovers consistency.
- Token 20030 [questionable statement]: Assumes the conjugate term simplifies to `b=\varepsilon/a`, omitting power-of-2 scaling.
- Token 22544 [mistake]: This wrong relation breaks known checks (`n=2` gives `80`/`49` instead of `66`), exposing a concrete modular error.
- Token 23507 [missed opportunity]: Tries truncated modular summation as a validator even though the infinite series tail is nonzero.
- Token 29914 [insight]: Re-derives the conjugate mapping carefully and spots the missing denominator scaling from `2^N`.
- Token 31614 [breakthrough]: Corrects to `b=\varepsilon \cdot a^{-1}\cdot 4^{-N}`, fixing the modular derivation.
- Token 32302 [verification]: Re-test now matches `Q(P(2),109)=66`, confirming the correction.
- Token 33708 [verification]: Computes the target case `N=10^{18}` modulo `1,000,000,009` and gets `984524441`.
- Token 36492 [verification]: Confirms the same result under both square-root choices for `5` modulo `p`.
- Token 36919 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{984524441}`; this final answer is correct.
