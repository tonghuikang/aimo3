## Answer: correct (984524441)

## Key moments
- Token 233 [questionable statement]: Floats the claim that the first `HH` might not occur at odd indices (`P(M=3)=0`), which is an unstable assumption.
- Token 1126 [insight]: Sets up the no-`HH` string-count recurrence and connects it to Fibonacci structure.
- Token 1605 [breakthrough]: Derives the core PMF `P(M=n)=F_{n-1}/2^n`, enabling closed-form work.
- Token 1852 [mistake]: Confirms the earlier odd-index claim was wrong after checking `M=3` explicitly.
- Token 2230 [breakthrough]: Correctly reframes the target as divisibility, `P(n)=\sum_{m>=1}P(M=mn)`, instead of `P(M=n)`.
- Token 4037-4842 [wasted]: Long re-derivation of subsequence generating-function/Binet setup already established earlier.
- Token 9150 [insight]: Uses conjugate-denominator multiplication to expose Lucas/Fibonacci cancellation structure.
- Token 9785 [breakthrough]: Obtains the exact rational form `P(n)=\frac{2^nF_{n-1}+(-1)^{n-1}}{2^{2n}-L_n2^n+(-1)^n}`.
- Token 9949 [verification]: Validates the formula against the given checks `P(2)=3/5` and `P(3)=9/31`.
- Token 12990 [missed opportunity]: Tries to validate the infinite-sum formula via finite truncation equality instead of symbolic equivalence.
- Token 13398 [questionable statement]: Treats finite partial-sum mismatch as if it should exactly match the infinite closed form.
- Token 13398 [mistake]: Uses that truncation mismatch as a diagnostic signal before accounting for nonzero tail terms.
- Token 17252 [breakthrough]: Resolves the truncation confusion and returns to the valid closed-form path.
- Token 17258 [verification]: Checks denominator invertibility modulo `1,000,000,009` before final modular division.
- Token 17333 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{984524441}`; this final answer is correct.
