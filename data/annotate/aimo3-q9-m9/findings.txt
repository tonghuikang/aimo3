Correct answer: 210

Correct approach
- Encode \(\alpha\) by \(A(x)=\sum_{i=0}^9 \alpha(i)x^i\). With a reversed/reindexed \(\beta\), the condition becomes
  \(A(x)\,G(x)=x^k+x^l=x^r(1+x^m)\) with \(m>0\), \(G\in\mathbb Z[x,x^{-1}]\).
- Therefore \(\alpha\) is shifty iff
  \(A(x)=\pm x^a D(x)\), where \(D(x)\in\mathbb Z[x]\) divides \(1+x^m\) for some \(m\ge1\), and \(a+\deg D\le 9\).
- Factorization fact:
  \(x^m+1=\prod_{d\mid 2m,\ d\nmid m}\Phi_d(x)\).
  So \(D\) is a product of distinct cyclotomic factors from one valid \(x^m+1\); equivalently, all cyclotomic indices used in \(D\) must share the same 2-adic layer \(v_2\).
- Under \(\deg D\le 9\), the relevant even-index cyclotomics are:
  - \(v_2=1\): \(\Phi_2,\Phi_6,\Phi_{10},\Phi_{14},\Phi_{18},\Phi_{30}\) with degrees \(1,2,4,6,6,8\)
  - \(v_2=2\): \(\Phi_4,\Phi_{12},\Phi_{20}\) with degrees \(2,4,8\)
  - \(v_2=3\): \(\Phi_8,\Phi_{24}\) with degrees \(4,8\)
  - \(v_2=4\): \(\Phi_{16}\) with degree \(8\)
- Let \(B_d\) be the number of monic admissible \(D\) of degree \(d\) (including \(D=1\)): 
  \((B_0,\dots,B_9)=(1,1,2,1,3,1,4,3,6,3)\).
- For each \(D\) of degree \(d\):
  - shifts \(a\): \(10-d\) choices,
  - global sign: 2 choices.
  Total:
  \[\sum_{d=0}^9 2B_d(10-d)=210.\]

Common wrong approaches (and wrong totals)
- Ignoring the monomial shift \(x^a\) and counting only primitive \(D\) with sign gives 50.
- Counting only non-empty primitive subsets with sign gives 48.
- Double-counting the empty subset across multiple \(v_2\)-groups, then applying shift/sign, gives 270.
- Forcing extra restrictions like “\(a_0=\pm1\) only”, “binary coefficients only”, or “\(\beta\) must have support 2” incorrectly removes valid constructions (including shifted monomial cases and cancellation-based cases).
