## Answer: correct (210)

## Key moments
- Token 2236 [insight]: Reframes the condition as an integer linear combination of shifts of \(\alpha\) equaling \(\delta_k+\delta_l\).
- Token 3238 [breakthrough]: Switches to a Laurent-polynomial/ideal formulation, turning the problem into divisibility by a binomial.
- Token 11608 [questionable statement]: Introduces an inconsistent special-case factorization of \(x^q+1\) that does not hold uniformly.
- Token 11608 [mistake]: Uses the wrong factorization pattern for \(x^q+1\), which would lead to incorrect factor counting.
- Token 11834 [breakthrough]: Corrects to \(x^n+1=\prod_{d\mid 2n,\,d\nmid n}\Phi_d(x)\), restoring the correct classification path.
- Token 14840 [questionable statement]: States that the first nonzero coefficient of \(\alpha\) must be exactly \(+1\).
- Token 14840 [mistake]: Omits global sign freedom and temporarily undercounts by excluding \(-P\) variants.
- Token 16518 [missed opportunity]: Could have fixed the single-\(v_2\)-group constraint earlier to avoid later recounting.
- Token 25527-27732 [wasted]: Long detour on divisor-sign edge cases before extracting the key correction.
- Token 28783 [breakthrough]: Correctly reinstates global sign freedom (\(P\) and \(-P\)) and updates the count from 105 to 210.
- Token 33276 [missed opportunity]: Launches heavy extra brute-force/debug passes after the analytic count was essentially complete.
- Token 42112 [verification]: Performs corrected large-range verification and confirms all constructed signed candidates satisfy the shifty condition.
- Token 42768 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{210}\).
