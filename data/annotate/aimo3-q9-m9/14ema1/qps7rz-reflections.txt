## Answer: correct (210)

## Key moments
- Token 2817 [insight]: Reduces the condition to Laurent-binomial divisibility, i.e., \(\alpha\) must divide a two-monomial target up to units.
- Token 4974 [breakthrough]: Applies the correct cyclotomic factorization of \(x^n+1\) and extracts the key \(v_2\)-compatibility constraint.
- Token 6761 [breakthrough]: Establishes the canonical form \(A=\pm x^r D\) with \(D\) from one \(v_2\)-group and \(r\) bounded by support \([0,9]\).
- Token 11169 [insight]: Converts the structural classification into a finite counting problem over subset degrees plus sign.
- Token 15495 [verification]: Reconciles the structural count with the computed total 210 and checks construction logic for all classes.
- Token 17189 [verification]: Re-checks \(\sum_D 2(10-\deg D)\) and uniqueness/no-collision assumptions for \((D,r,\pm)\).
- Token 18960-19200 [wasted]: Starts an additional bounded brute-force search discussion after the proof and count are already complete.
- Token 19822 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{210}\).
