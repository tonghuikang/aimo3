## Answer: wrong (50)

## Key moments
- Token 639 [questionable statement]: Assumes \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) should be binary-valued to get output values in \(\{0,1\}\).
- Token 639 [mistake]: This incorrectly narrows the search space; integer cancellations can still produce value 1.
- Token 2200 [insight]: Reframes the condition as Laurent-polynomial divisibility of a two-monomial target.
- Token 8880 [breakthrough]: Correctly identifies the same-\(v_2\) compatibility condition for cyclotomic factors dividing \(x^N+1\).
- Token 9043 [questionable statement]: Fixes \(A\) as only \(\pm\prod \Phi_d\) with degree \(\le 9\), implicitly anchored at exponent 0.
- Token 9043 [mistake]: Omits the monomial shift factor \(x^c\), so it misses the \((10-d)\) placement multiplicity that dominates the final count.
- Token 11823-15912 [wasted]: Long repeated reaffirmation of intermediate totals (mostly 48) without revisiting the missing-shift issue.
- Token 16959 [questionable statement]: "Repairs" 48 to 50 by adding the empty subset case, still using the same incomplete counting model.
- Token 17429 [mistake]: Commits to \(48+2=50\), preserving the structural undercount.
- Token 18138 [missed opportunity]: Final checks focus on subset bookkeeping instead of testing shifted instances that would expose missing \(x^c\) factors.
- Token 19268 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{50}\).
