## Answer: correct (210)

## Key moments
- Token 683 [questionable statement]: Narrows intuition toward "delta-like" \(\alpha\), an unnecessary restriction at this stage.
- Token 769 [mistake]: Suggests \(\gamma\) should have support size at most 2, which is false because cancellations can still yield two spikes.
- Token 2200 [insight]: Recasts the target as divisibility of a binomial \(x^k+x^l\) in the Laurent-polynomial view.
- Token 2445 [breakthrough]: Makes the usable criterion explicit: after removing monomial shift, the primitive part must divide \(x^d+1\).
- Token 11742 [questionable statement]: Initially treats "any subset of even-index cyclotomics" as automatically feasible.
- Token 11742 [mistake]: This overgeneralizes and misses compatibility constraints among factors.
- Token 12273 [breakthrough]: Correctly imposes the same \(v_2(m/2)\) condition across factors, fixing subset admissibility.
- Token 21195 [questionable statement]: Chooses \(N=2^{e+1}L\) while still requiring \(N/d_m\) odd.
- Token 21195 [mistake]: That choice forces \(N/d_m\) even, so the divisibility condition fails.
- Token 21569 [breakthrough]: Repairs to \(N=2^eL\), restoring the odd-quotient condition and consistent construction.
- Token 23601-24434 [verification]: Implements `test_alpha` and checks constructed candidates against the defining convolution behavior.
- Token 29432-30078 [wasted]: Starts a heavy bounded brute-force search plan after the structural classification/count is already established.
- Token 32167 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{210}\).
