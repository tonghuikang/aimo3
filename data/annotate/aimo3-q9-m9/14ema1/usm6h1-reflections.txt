## Answer: correct (210)

## Key moments
- Token 1425 [insight]: Reformulates the requirement in Laurent-polynomial language, with \(A\) dividing a two-monomial target up to units.
- Token 4663 [breakthrough]: Extracts the core structure \(A=x^a f\), where the primitive part \(f\) must divide some \(1+x^d\).
- Token 6409 [breakthrough]: Identifies the key compatibility rule that cyclotomic factors in \(f\) must share the same 2-adic layer.
- Token 7763 [insight]: Converts structure into a count: choose admissible \(D\), shift \(a\in[0,9-\deg D]\), and sign \(\pm\).
- Token 15134 [breakthrough]: Gives an explicit witness construction \(\alpha=\pm x^rD\), \(\beta=\pm (x^M+1)/D\), yielding exactly two unit spikes.
- Token 18976-19922 [wasted]: Long re-justification of completeness and coefficient edge cases after the classification is already established.
- Token 20144 [verification]: Runs explicit enumeration over admissible subsets/shifts/signs and rechecks the total count computationally.
- Token 21351 [verification]: Verifies that each counted class satisfies the original shifty condition via the constructed product form.
- Token 21995 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{210}\).
