## Answer: wrong (270)

## Key moments
- Token 3193 [questionable statement]: Frames the condition as divisibility in \(\mathbb Z[z]\) alone, without fully handling Laurent-shift freedom.
- Token 3591 [mistake]: Treats shifty \(\alpha\) as ordinary divisors of \(z^m+1\), which initially suppresses monomial-shift cases.
- Token 8153 [insight]: Uses cyclotomic factorization of \(x^n+1\) to organize admissible irreducible factors.
- Token 10695-11357 [wasted]: Repeats equivalent subset/sign restatements for many tokens before moving to an executable count.
- Token 13367 [breakthrough]: Correctly reintroduces Laurent monomial shifts and recovers the form \(A(z)=z^sP(z)\).
- Token 20449 [breakthrough]: Sets up the right counting skeleton: sum \((10-\deg P)\) over primitive \(P\), then account for sign.
- Token 21240 [questionable statement]: Generates subset data group-by-group with empty subset present in each group.
- Token 21743 [questionable statement]: Uses the non-deduplicated `valid` list as if it represented unique primitive factors.
- Token 21743 [mistake]: Filters `valid` from non-deduplicated `poly_info`, so the empty subset is counted multiple times.
- Token 21858 [mistake]: Propagates the inflated intermediate total (135) and doubles it to 270.
- Token 21858 [missed opportunity]: No sanity check is applied to reconcile the counted objects with deduplicated subset structure.
- Token 21927 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{270}\).
