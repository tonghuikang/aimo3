## Answer: wrong (19677)

## Key moments
- Token 314 [insight]: States the right objective: find the 36th valid start `a` and reduce modulo `99991`.
- Token 523 [insight]: Correctly frames the problem as Hall/perfect-matching over divisibility sets.
- Token 6535 [breakthrough]: Commits to algorithmic enumeration rather than only manual pattern-spotting.
- Token 11783 [verification]: Benchmarks scan complexity and recognizes that a direct linear search may need very large bounds.
- Token 15651 [verification]: Confirms empirical sparsity (only trivial small starts found), motivating a different search strategy.
- Token 20697 [insight]: Switches from plain scanning toward constructing solutions via structured offset assignments.
- Token 26528 [breakthrough]: Recasts solutions as CRT classes induced by offset bijections, enabling branch-and-bound over assignments.
- Token 33659 [insight]: Adds lower-bound pruning (`a_cur`) to prioritize small solutions and maintain a top-36 heap.
- Token 42355 [verification]: Runs the bounded DFS for `L=36` and obtains 36 candidate values before timeout.
- Token 42902 [questionable statement]: Treats the 36 collected values as "the 36 smallest" despite the search having timed out.
- Token 42942 [mistake]: Assumes sorted found-set is complete for the target rank, even though many branches remain unexplored.
- Token 43617 [questionable statement]: Argues pruning guarantees correctness, but this argument depends on full traversal below threshold.
- Token 43706 [mistake]: Uses the incomplete pruning argument to justify the candidate `a_36 = 13104848877121`.
- Token 44294 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly recognizes possible missing smaller solutions but does not execute a complete bounded proof run.
- Token 50342 [missed opportunity]: Proposes a decisive verification (`enumerate all <= a_36`) yet fails to complete it successfully.
- Token 53106-55339 [wasted]: Performs random sampling checks, which are too weak to establish rank completeness.
- Token 54703 [final answer]: Commits to modulo result `19677`, which is incorrect.
