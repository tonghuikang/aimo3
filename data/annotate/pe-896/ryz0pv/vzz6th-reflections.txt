## Answer: correct (18527)

## Key moments
- Token 22 [insight]: Reframes the interval-permutation condition as a bipartite perfect-matching problem between positions and numbers.
- Token 1117 [insight]: Notes that divisibility structure repeats with period `lcm(1..36)`, setting up a residue-class strategy.
- Token 7382 [breakthrough]: Commits to a computational path (matching-based search) instead of only qualitative reasoning.
- Token 14054 [verification]: Confirms repeated bounded searches are not reaching 36 solutions, reinforcing that naive scan depth is insufficient.
- Token 20724 [verification]: Counts valid starts up to 2 million and confirms only `a=1..5` appear early, establishing extreme sparsity.
- Token 24576 [questionable statement]: Tries to explain the `1..5` phenomenon with a broad modular heuristic, which is not sufficient to characterize all valid ranges.
- Token 24734-32535 [wasted]: Explores many sparse-candidate scans without yet switching to a complete residue-enumeration method.
- Token 32535 [missed opportunity]: Continues debating scan bounds instead of pivoting immediately to full modulo-period enumeration.
- Token 42528 [missed opportunity]: Keeps iterating on candidate-filtering arguments instead of fully committing to exhaustive CRT/CSP construction earlier.
- Token 49557 [insight]: Recognizes that sorting complete base residues modulo `lcm(1..36)` is enough to read off the 36th solution directly.
- Token 53066 [breakthrough]: Switches to constructive CRT/CSP enumeration of valid offset assignments modulo `lcm(1..36)`.
- Token 56130 [breakthrough]: Implements the CSP generator that enforces congruence-compatibility constraints across offsets.
- Token 58949 [verification]: Successfully generates all base residues (`18240`), then sorts them to identify early valid starts.
- Token 59696 [verification]: Checks the candidate 36th start with matching and verifies exactly 35 smaller positive residues exist.
- Token 59908 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{18527}`, which matches the correct answer.
