## Answer: wrong (81935)

## Key moments
- Token 107 [insight]: Correctly interprets the task as ranking valid starts `a` for length-36 ranges.
- Token 656 [breakthrough]: Identifies the bipartite perfect-matching formulation.
- Token 1513 [verification]: Uses small-length examples to validate Hall-style failure modes and confirm nontrivial gaps.
- Token 7908 [verification]: Empirically finds only `a=1..5` in early brute-force windows, establishing sparsity.
- Token 13220 [insight]: Recognizes that the target rank likely lies far beyond naive scan limits.
- Token 20697-38170 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch on density heuristics and conjectural growth arguments without constructing a complete rank-safe method.
- Token 29066 [insight]: Extracts periodic structure via `lcm(19..36)` and links large-index constraints to residue behavior.
- Token 38170 [questionable statement]: Conjectures the solution set is probably only residue classes `a ≡ 1..5 (mod M)`.
- Token 45048 [missed opportunity]: Briefly notes that this assumption is unsafe but does not pivot to exhaustive residue enumeration.
- Token 46320 [mistake]: Computes the 36th start as if there are exactly 5 solutions per period (`a_36 = 7M+1`), which is false.
- Token 50040 [questionable statement]: Reasserts that only the constant-pattern classes likely work, despite lacking a completeness proof.
- Token 51902 [missed opportunity]: Describes an offset-CRT enumeration route that could settle completeness, but does not execute it.
- Token 53038 [mistake]: Finalizes the unsupported "only constant pattern works" claim.
- Token 53732 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{81935}`, which is incorrect.
