## Answer: correct (94741)

## Key moments
- Token 273 [questionable statement]: While deriving edge BC, the trace writes `y=b(1+x/c)` and then incorrectly claims the equivalent form is `y=b-(b/c)x`, introducing a sign inconsistency.
- Token 273 [mistake]: The incorrect BC rearrangement could have flipped later geometric inequalities if reused.
- Token 696-2815 [wasted]: Long half-plane/orientation derivations consume substantial tokens before switching to Pick's Theorem, which makes most of that setup unnecessary for counting.
- Token 2827 [insight]: The trace pivots to Pick's Theorem (`I = Area - B/2 + 1`) as the right counting framework for interior lattice points.
- Token 4318 [breakthrough]: It consolidates to the usable formula `I = ((a+c)(b+d) - (gcd(a,b)+gcd(b,c)+gcd(c,d)+gcd(d,a)))/2 + 1`.
- Token 7292 [missed opportunity]: It continues debating whether brute force is feasible instead of immediately timing an optimized implementation.
- Token 9523 [verification]: Full `m=100` brute-force run returns `(694687, ~10.09s)`, confirming the main count computation path.
- Token 9962 [verification]: Re-checking `m=4` gives `42`, matching the prompt and validating interpretation/implementation.
- Token 10235 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{94741}` after modulo reduction.
