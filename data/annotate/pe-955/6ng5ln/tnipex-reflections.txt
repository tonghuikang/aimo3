## Answer: wrong (69035)

## Key moments
- Token 5150 [insight]: Derives the segment formula `a_t = T_x + T_t` after a triangular hit, which gives a workable local model.
- Token 5289 [breakthrough]: Reduces the transition to the minimal `t>0` such that `T_x + T_t` is triangular.
- Token 7693 [insight]: Converts the triangular-sum condition into a factorization form `UV = x(x+1)` with `b = V-U`.
- Token 8433 [breakthrough]: States the factor-pair transition rule and formulas for `t` and the next triangular index.
- Token 13701 [questionable statement]: Assumes the next step is controlled by the smallest odd divisor of the odd factor `O`.
- Token 13937 [mistake]: Commits to a recurrence based on that smallest-divisor heuristic, which is not generally valid.
- Token 14009-16840 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch refining the same odd-factor heuristic before abandoning it.
- Token 16275 [questionable statement]: Reframes the search as choosing the largest odd divisor below `\sqrt{N}`, narrowing candidates incorrectly.
- Token 24023 [mistake]: Implements `d_max = max(d1, d2)`, which omits mixed products and yields wrong transitions.
- Token 26196 [verification]: Cross-check against known checkpoints catches divergence (`m_9=4228` instead of `1696`).
- Token 27086 [insight]: Identifies missing mixed odd-divisor products (e.g., `13*37=481` for `x=1183`).
- Token 27259 [breakthrough]: Updates the candidate set to products of odd divisors from both `x` and `x+1`.
- Token 29931 [questionable statement]: Declares the generator "works well" after only limited prefix validation.
- Token 29937 [mistake]: Trusts the flawed generator output for the 70th term (`n=1723633764567540`).
- Token 30127 [missed opportunity]: Notes full direct simulation is infeasible but does not add an independent mathematical check of late transitions.
- Token 30442 [verification]: Re-checks early indices and counting convention, but this only validates the prefix.
- Token 30851 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{69035}`, which is incorrect.
