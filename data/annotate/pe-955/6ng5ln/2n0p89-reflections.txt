## Answer: correct (99862)

## Key moments
- Token 398 [insight]: Identifies that the non-triangular branch has constant second difference and starts deriving a closed-form segment rule.
- Token 4869 [breakthrough]: Reaches the useful reduction `a_{i+k} = T_m + T_k`, turning the next-hit search into a triangular-sum problem.
- Token 4922 [questionable statement]: Questions the formula using `k=3` at the initial segment and mixes segment boundaries, which sets up a wrong recurrence application.
- Token 5160 [insight]: Flags the indexing/reset inconsistency explicitly and re-derives the segment boundary conditions.
- Token 5316 [mistake]: Applies the recurrence as if it should run at `n=2` and briefly infers `a_3=9`, contradicting the given sequence where `a_2` being triangular forces `a_3=7`.
- Token 5824 [breakthrough]: Corrects the reset logic and re-anchors the segment interpretation, recovering a consistent derivation path.
- Token 7709 [insight]: Converts `T_m + T_k = T_{m'}` into `(z-y)(z+y)=x^2-1`, linking transitions to factor pairs of `m(m+1)`.
- Token 8415 [insight]: Connects “minimal positive `k`” to minimizing divisor-pair difference, providing the criterion used in the final transition rule.
- Token 9290 [breakthrough]: Spots the trivial `(m, m+1)` factor pair as the `k=0` self-loop and explicitly excludes it.
- Token 9547 [breakthrough]: Finalizes the transition rule: choose the nearest nontrivial admissible factor pair, then compute both `m'` and the index jump `k`.
- Token 15114-16414 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch on parity/divisor casework that repeats constraints without changing the implemented transition algorithm.
- Token 19399 [verification]: Checks that the computed indexing convention reproduces `n_{10}=2964`, matching the problem’s anchor.
- Token 22244 [verification]: Performs an explicit off-by-one audit (`a_0` as 1st triangular hit, `n_list[69]` for the 70th), confirming counting consistency.
- Token 22693 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{99862}`.
