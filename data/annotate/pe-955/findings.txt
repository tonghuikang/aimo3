# PE 955 Annotation Findings

## Problem
Find the index `n` such that `a_n` is the 70th triangular term appearing in the sequence, then report `n mod 99991`.

## Correct Answer
- `99862`
- Equivalent full index: `n = 6795261671274`

## Correct Approach
- Let triangular values be `T_k = k(k+1)/2`.
- If `a_{n_i} = T_{m_i}` is a triangular hit, then inside that segment:
  - `a_{n_i+t} = T_{m_i} + T_t`.
- So the next hit solves:
  - `T_{m_i} + T_t = T_{m_{i+1}}` with minimal positive `t`.
- This becomes a factor-pair step on `N = m_i(m_i+1)`:
  - choose factor pairs `(P,Q)` with `PQ=N`, `P<Q`, and `Q-P` odd;
  - `t = (Q-P-1)/2`, `m_{i+1} = (P+Q-1)/2`;
  - exclude the trivial `(P,Q)=(m_i,m_i+1)` pair (`t=0`).
- Update indices by `n_{i+1} = n_i + t`, with `n_0=0, m_0=2`.
- Consistency anchor: the 10th triangular term is `a_{2964} = 1439056 = T_{1696}`.

## Wrong Approach A
- Uses an "odd divisor only" heuristic (e.g., largest odd divisor below a threshold, or simplified odd-part candidates) instead of the full valid factor-pair condition.
- This misses valid transitions and eventually drifts to the wrong trajectory.
- Produced wrong 70th index `n = 1723633764567540`, giving modulo answer `69035`.

## Wrong Approach B
- Uses incomplete candidate families for near-sqrt factor pairs and/or fragile exclusions of trivial/self-loop cases.
- Early checkpoints can match, but later transitions are wrong because valid pairs are still omitted.
- Produced wrong modulo answer `87384`.
