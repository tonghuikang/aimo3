## Answer: wrong (933863359)

## Key moments
- Token 167 [insight]: Establishes the correct step-function view of \(S_B(m)\) over prime-threshold intervals.
- Token 3438 [insight]: Rewrites \(G(p)\)-style terms via smooth-factorial ratios, giving a plausible computational target.
- Token 10002 [missed opportunity]: Recognizes brute-force scaling failure but continues broad speculative rewrites without a tight executable plan.
- Token 15930 [insight]: Reframes around per-\(B\) aggregate sums instead of per-coefficient direct expansion.
- Token 21977 [insight]: Confirms modulus properties needed for modular inverses/exponent handling.
- Token 25507 [breakthrough]: Forms the weighted-prime accumulation strategy for assembling \(F(n)\).
- Token 32338 [missed opportunity]: Small-\(n\) decomposition checks are not turned into a strict regression harness for later implementations.
- Token 41206-45243 [wasted]: Long theory-heavy redesign cycle (DP/convolution/block ideas) without a stable computable transition.
- Token 48691 [insight]: Identifies the key transition factor structure via \(v_p(r!) + v_p((n-r)!)\).
- Token 58189 [wasted]: Additional redesign attempts still do not yield a validated large-\(n\) updater.
- Token 64035 [questionable statement]: Treats heavy block/range-update cost as potentially practical despite very high operation counts.
- Token 71122 [insight]: Manual \(n=4\) walkthrough exposes nontrivial center/edge multiplicative behavior.
- Token 75890 [questionable statement]: Introduces an interval update implementation that effectively tracks power thresholds instead of all required multiples.
- Token 81091 [mistake]: The resulting \(T\)-array mismatch confirms the implemented transition rule is mathematically incorrect.
- Token 82971 [breakthrough]: Derives the correct requirement: every multiple of \(p^k\) must contribute, not just \(p^k\) thresholds.
- Token 83471 [breakthrough]: States the proper fix as suffix/prefix updates for each multiple of each prime power.
- Token 89245 [missed opportunity]: After concluding Python is infeasible, does not lock in a fully revalidated corrected implementation path.
- Token 90140 [questionable statement]: Jumps to a C++ block implementation before revalidating the corrected multiple-based logic end-to-end.
- Token 93609 [mistake]: Accepts computed value 933863359, which is not the true result.
- Token 93633 [missed opportunity]: Moves directly to final response without checkpoint cross-validation against a trusted path.
- Token 93640 [final answer]: Commits wrong boxed answer 933863359.
