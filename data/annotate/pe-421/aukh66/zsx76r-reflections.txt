## Answer: correct (81624)

## Key moments
- Token 120 [insight]: Rewrites the objective as `Σ_{p≤M} p · #{n≤N : p | n^15+1}`, correctly handling distinct-prime counting.
- Token 946 [insight]: Sets up the group-theoretic congruence `15k ≡ (p-1)/2 (mod p-1)` with `d=gcd(15,p-1)` as the key parameter.
- Token 1338 [breakthrough]: Proves for odd primes that the divisibility condition is always satisfied, so solutions always exist and count is `d`.
- Token 1637 [verification]: Checks small primes (`p=5`, `p=7`) explicitly to confirm the abstract condition matches concrete residues.
- Token 3697 [missed opportunity]: Already has `A(p)=d·⌊N/p⌋+t(p)` but diverts into speculative transforms instead of implementing directly.
- Token 3708-6937 [wasted]: Extended detour through average/distribution and sum-reordering ideas for `t(p)` without producing an executable shortcut.
- Token 4458 [questionable statement]: Starts residue-class classification with uncertain/inconsistent modular lists.
- Token 4730 [mistake]: Commits to an incorrect intermediate class list for `d=1` (including invalid residue handling), creating temporary classification noise.
- Token 4972 [breakthrough]: Fixes the residue-class breakdown and restores a consistent mapping from `p mod` classes to `d` values.
- Token 7270 [insight]: Reframes solutions via element orders dividing 30 but not 15, isolating admissible orders `{2,6,10,30}`.
- Token 7733 [breakthrough]: Correctly counts solutions via `φ(2)+φ(6)+φ(10)+φ(30)` and reconciles this with `gcd(15,p-1)` behavior.
- Token 9769 [insight]: Converts the remainder term into counting subgroup elements against a threshold (`b ≥ p-r`), making `t(p)` computable.
- Token 12339 [breakthrough]: Finalizes a concrete segmented-sieve implementation with primitive `d`-th roots to compute per-prime extras exactly.
- Token 13992-15123 [wasted]: Long runtime/memory anxiety and scaling checks delay the already-defined implementation path.
- Token 16024 [verification]: Runs brute-force vs fast-method validation on small cases to confirm correctness.
- Token 16850 [verification]: Executes the full `N=10^11, M=10^8` computation and additional sanity checks.
- Token 18098 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{81624}` after verified computation.
