## Answer: correct (60418)

## Key moments
- Token 123 [insight]: Recasts the pair count as \(S(n)=\sum_{b\mid n}(\tau(b)-1)\), turning the task into divisor-function algebra.
- Token 697 [insight]: Gets the exponent-form product \(S(n)=\prod_i\frac{(e_i+1)(e_i+2)}{2}-\prod_i(e_i+1)\), which is the structural basis for valuation work.
- Token 1340 [breakthrough]: Specializes to \(E(m,s)=\nu_2\!\left(((s+1)(s+2)/2)^m-(s+1)^m\right)\), isolating the exact 2-adic target.
- Token 3155 [questionable statement]: Briefly drifts into mixed LTE templates despite opposite-parity bases.
- Token 2973 [insight]: Switches to a parity-first case split for \((a+1)^m-2^m\), setting up a cleaner path.
- Token 3369 [breakthrough]: Resolves the odd-branch directly (odd minus even is odd), so that valuation term is 0 there.
- Token 5254 [insight]: For even \(s\), identifies \(c=(s+2)/2\) and that \(c\)'s parity controls \(\nu_2(c^m-1)\).
- Token 6035 [breakthrough]: Final piecewise rule for odd \(m\): odd \(s\Rightarrow E=m(v_2(s+1)-1)\), even \(s\Rightarrow E=v_2(s)-1\).
- Token 6328 [insight]: Reindexes odd and even indices to the same \(k\)-range, exposing matching valuation kernels.
- Token 7073 [breakthrough]: Collapses the sum to \(Q(N)=(m+1)\sum_{k=1}^{N/2}v_2(k)\).
- Token 7149 [verification]: Validates the formula against the provided checkpoint \(Q(8)=2714886\).
- Token 7326 [insight]: Uses the divisor-count view \(\sum_{k=1}^{M}v_2(k)=\sum_{j\ge1}\lfloor M/2^j\rfloor\).
- Token 8224 [breakthrough]: Confirms the closed form \(\sum_{k=1}^{M}v_2(k)=M-\mathrm{popcount}(M)\), enabling direct evaluation.
- Token 10724-11122 [wasted]: Long manual big-number multiplication/zero-counting detour before returning to simple modular computation.
- Token 12200 [verification]: Runs extra independent checks (small \(N\), odd \(m\), and large-\(m\) consistency) to confirm stability.
- Token 12868 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{60418}\), which is correct.
