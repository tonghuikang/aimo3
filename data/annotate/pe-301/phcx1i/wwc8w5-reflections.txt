## Answer: correct (78498)

## Key moments
- Token 34 [insight]: Starts from the core Nim fact that the losing condition is zero nim-sum, giving `n XOR 2n XOR 3n = 0`.
- Token 275 [breakthrough]: Reframes the equation through carry logic (`a+b` vs `a XOR b`) and reduces it to a bit-overlap condition.
- Token 734 [insight]: Uses the left-shift structure of `2n` to connect overlap to adjacency in `n`’s bits.
- Token 1003 [breakthrough]: Converts the algebraic condition into the combinatorial one: `n` must have no consecutive 1s.
- Token 1233 [insight]: Introduces `B(N)` and explicitly tracks zero/nonzero counting, which sets up endpoint handling.
- Token 2028 [questionable statement]: Becomes uncertain about whether the `Fib(32)` count already includes/excludes zero before adding/removing boundary terms.
- Token 2028 [mistake]: Temporarily mixes counting sets (`[0,2^30-1]`, positives only, and inclusion of `2^30`) in a way that risks double subtraction/addition.
- Token 2262 [breakthrough]: Resolves the bookkeeping cleanly and restores the correct total as `Fib(32)` for positive `n ≤ 2^30`.
- Token 3341 [verification]: Performs an explicit modulo recomputation (`2178309 - 99991*21`) to confirm remainder `78498`.
- Token 3475-3932 [wasted]: After the count and modulo are already settled, spends many tokens on redundant brute-force and meta rechecks.
- Token 3932 [missed opportunity]: Continues planning how to present the derivation instead of finalizing immediately.
- Token 4080 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{78498}`.
