## Answer: correct (97849)

## Key moments
- Token 63 [insight]: Frames the task as identifying structural P-positions rather than brute-counting huge `N=7^{17}` directly.
- Token 2999 [breakthrough]: Moves to explicit DP computation of small states to extract the game’s actual pattern.
- Token 4272 [insight]: Early residue-class observations (`(2,b)` around `3 mod 4`, `(1,b)` odd) provide the first concrete pattern clues.
- Token 7248 [questionable statement]: Tries tying the modulus directly to `a` (e.g., `2^a`-style intuition), which is too rigid.
- Token 7362 [mistake]: Applying that idea to `a=3` predicts the wrong congruence class and conflicts with enumerated data.
- Token 8271 [breakthrough]: Re-indexes by `m = floor(log2(a)) + 1`, yielding the correct rule `b ≡ 2^m-1 (mod 2^m)`.
- Token 11775 [verification]: Runs `test_up_to(200)` to check that the closed-form condition matches DP outcomes.
- Token 14148 [verification]: Evaluates the fast counting formula at `N=7**17` and obtains the target residue computation.
- Token 16039-16132 [wasted]: Additional reassurance/testing discussion after the result is already established does not materially change the solution.
- Token 16147 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{97849}` (correct).
