## Answer: correct (6660)

## Key moments
- Token 399 [questionable statement]: Confuses the arc-midpoint point on the circumcircle with excenter-related constructions, starting an unstable geometric setup.
- Token 399-2259 [wasted]: Long recall-and-recall loop about arc midpoint/excenter identities without producing a usable DI formula.
- Token 8166 [questionable statement]: Generalizes `DI = 2r/sin(A/2)` from a single checked example.
- Token 8297 [mistake]: Treats that candidate formula as if it may be the general relation.
- Token 8694 [verification]: Tests additional examples and finds the formula fails, correctly rejecting the earlier conjecture.
- Token 9679 [insight]: Identifies the productive structure `DI = DB = DC` via the circumcenter-of-`BIC` viewpoint.
- Token 10197 [breakthrough]: Derives `DI = a/(2 cos(A/2))`, converting the geometry condition into an algebraic side relation.
- Token 12628 [insight]: Notices the quadratic discriminant in `c` simplifies to `a^4`, signaling a clean closed form is available.
- Token 13179 [breakthrough]: Obtains `c = (a^2-b^2)/b`, yielding the core integrality condition `b | a^2`.
- Token 14661 [insight]: Simplifies triangle inequalities to interval constraints on `b`.
- Token 15100 [breakthrough]: Finalizes the divisor-interval characterization `a/2 < b < a` (with `b|a^2`) for valid triangles.
- Token 17191 [questionable statement]: Assumes divisors above `a` must look like `a*k` with integer `k|a`.
- Token 17348 [mistake]: From that assumption, reaches a contradiction (`1 < k < 2` impossible), which would wrongly suggest no solutions.
- Token 17856 [insight]: Uses the concrete counterexample (`a=6`, divisor `9`) to diagnose the structural error in the previous assumption.
- Token 19833 [breakthrough]: Rebuilds the divisor parameterization with reduced fractions `a*u/v` (coprime `u,v|a`), restoring a correct counting model.
- Token 21252 [breakthrough]: Swaps summation order to `\sum_{v<u<2v} vu * T(\lfloor L/(vu)\rfloor)`, the key computational form.
- Token 24329 [verification]: Checks multiplicativity numerically and rules it out, preventing an invalid simplification.
- Token 32910-41803 [wasted]: Repeated complexity/model reformulations without committing to an executable path.
- Token 42011-48719 [wasted]: Further detours into prefix-sum and Dirichlet-style ideas that do not resolve the computational bottleneck.
- Token 48809 [questionable statement]: Floats an approximation `w(n)\approx 1` for many `n`, which cannot support exact modular output.
- Token 56349 [missed opportunity]: Acknowledges approximations are unusable for exact modulo arithmetic but still delays implementation.
- Token 57058 [insight]: Decides to benchmark direct pair enumeration instead of continuing speculative transforms.
- Token 59768 [breakthrough]: Implements the modular brute-force summation approach and validates it on small test values.
- Token 60478 [verification]: Executes the `L=10^9` run and obtains residue `6660`.
- Token 60625 [verification]: Performs extra consistency checks to reduce off-by-one risk before finalizing.
- Token 61014 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{6660}`.
