## Answer: correct (6660)

## Key moments
- Token 244 [insight]: Sets the side notation clearly and frames the target condition as `b = DI`.
- Token 879 [insight]: Uses point-power on the circumcircle (`IA * ID = R^2 - OI^2`) to make `DI` computable.
- Token 1305 [breakthrough]: Derives `DI = 2R sin(A/2)` via Euler’s `OI` relation and `AI = r/sin(A/2)`.
- Token 1531 [breakthrough]: Converts the geometric condition into `b = a/(2cos(A/2))`.
- Token 3468 [breakthrough]: Eliminates angles to obtain the Diophantine side equation `a^2 c = b(a+b+c)(b+c-a)`.
- Token 4976 [insight]: Introduces `u = b+c-a` and linearizes the equation in `b`.
- Token 5042 [breakthrough]: Solves to `b = a^2/(a+u)`, exposing the divisor structure.
- Token 6152 [breakthrough]: Reduces triangle constraints to `d | a^2` with `a < d < 2a` (`d = a+u`), yielding the core parameterization.
- Token 7422 [verification]: Checks that the parameterization reproduces all sample triangles.
- Token 7759 [insight]: Rewrites the objective as `F(L) = Σ a * N(a)` where `N(a)` counts divisors of `a^2` in a narrow interval.
- Token 8010 [questionable statement]: Claims divisors `d < a` cannot have prime exponents above those in `a`.
- Token 8446 [mistake]: The above simplification is false (e.g., `a=12, d=8`), so this divisor-structure shortcut is invalid.
- Token 8471 [breakthrough]: Corrects course by reverting to interval counting on divisors of `a^2` without the invalid exponent restriction.
- Token 11221 [insight]: Reparameterizes with `a = d + t` and converts the condition to `d | t^2`, opening a number-theoretic counting view.
- Token 11385-17398 [wasted]: Extended alternate counting transformations (`d,t`, divisor-pair inversions) without a tractable final algorithm.
- Token 17976 [insight]: Returns to the productive `u,v,k` representation with explicit `K = min(u-1, floor(L/(uv))-u)`.
- Token 20383 [breakthrough]: Splits contributions into region 1/region 2 and expresses them through squarefree-weighted sums.
- Token 22549 [insight]: Uses `μ^2` and `μ^2(n)=Σ_{d^2|n} μ(d)` to make squarefree summation computable.
- Token 23746 [breakthrough]: Commits to a concrete algorithm over `u` with Möbius-transformed squarefree prefix sums.
- Token 29692-32556 [wasted]: Long complexity accounting and query-count debates before finalizing implementation details.
- Token 32751 [verification]: Confirms modular arithmetic prerequisites (including primality/mod inverse handling).
- Token 35273 [breakthrough]: Implements the final computation routine.
- Token 36704 [verification]: Confirms `F(15)=45` with the implementation.
- Token 37502 [verification]: Runs additional small-`L` checks to validate correctness.
- Token 37930 [verification]: Runs `L=10^9` and obtains residue `6660`.
- Token 38844 [verification]: Cross-checks against brute-force on small limits for consistency.
- Token 39375 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{6660}`.
