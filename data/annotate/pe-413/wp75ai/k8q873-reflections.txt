## Answer: correct (64573)

## Key moments
- Token 1484 [insight]: The trace frames the right mechanism: track residues of all suffixes ending at each position and update them with `(10r + x) mod d`.
- Token 4008 [questionable statement]: It assumes a subset-of-residues (`2^d`) state should be enough for exact counting.
- Token 4788 [mistake]: It treats that subset DP as exact, but subsets lose multiplicity of equal residues and therefore miscount zero-substring occurrences.
- Token 4795-10445 [wasted]: Large implementation effort goes into optimizing the flawed subset DP before validating it on stronger checks.
- Token 10665 [missed opportunity]: After a sample mismatch appears, debugging initially focuses on interpretation details instead of auditing information loss in the state representation.
- Token 14922 [insight]: A concrete counterexample (`6656`) exposes the root cause: multiple suffixes can share one residue and all map to zero together.
- Token 17526-23965 [wasted]: The trace detours through inclusion-exclusion and linear-system counting ideas that do not advance a practical solution.
- Token 24245 [breakthrough]: It switches to full residue-multiplicity vectors (`c_r`) and correctly computes per-step zero increments using counts, fixing the DP.
- Token 27911 [verification]: It rechecks against the provided checkpoint (`F(10^7)=277674`) and confirms consistency.
- Token 28343 [final answer]: It commits to the final result `\boxed{64573}`.
