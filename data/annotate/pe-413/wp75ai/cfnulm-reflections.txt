## Answer: correct (64573)

## Key moments
- Token 789 [insight]: The trace identifies a workable counting direction: process digits left-to-right and count divisible substrings as suffix remainders at each new position.
- Token 1428-5404 [wasted]: It spends a long span exploring inclusion-exclusion, heuristic distribution arguments, and raw state-space probes without a directly usable counting state.
- Token 6216 [questionable statement]: It considers reducing state to mostly zero/non-zero tracking, which risks dropping information needed for future zero events.
- Token 6319 [mistake]: It leans toward set-style suffix-remainder tracking; that would miss multiplicities and fail when multiple suffixes map to remainder 0 at one step.
- Token 6559 [insight]: The trace recognizes that multiplicity by remainder (counts per residue) is the correct compression, because future transitions depend on how many suffixes share each remainder.
- Token 11437 [breakthrough]: It implements the memoized DP on `(pos, zero_seen, counts_tuple)` with exact transition and `count_z` pruning rules, enabling full-length computation up to `d=19`.
- Token 15969 [missed opportunity]: After obtaining exact DP counts and passing anchor checks, it still spends extra effort on random-sampling plausibility checks.
- Token 17371 [verification]: It validates the computed table against given checkpoints (`F(10^3)=389`, `F(10^7)=277674`) before finalizing.
- Token 17481 [final answer]: It commits to the final modulo result `\boxed{64573}`.
