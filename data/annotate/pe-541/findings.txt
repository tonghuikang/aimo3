# Problem pe-541: M(137) - Largest n where denominator of H_n not divisible by p

## Correct Answer
63128

## Problem Summary
Find M(137), the largest n such that the denominator b_n of H_n (in reduced form) is not divisible by 137. Return answer mod 99991.

## Key Insight
For fixed prime p, define a number n as "good" when p does not divide the reduced denominator of H_n.
Using L_n = lcm(1,...,n), this is equivalent to:
- p does not divide b_n
- v_p(sum_{k=1}^n L_n/k) >= floor(log_p n)

So M(p) is the largest good n.

## Correct Approach (u09118.txt)
1. Implement a correct `is_good(n,p)` predicate from the p-adic condition above using modular inverse sums modulo powers of p.
2. Enumerate all good numbers by BFS in base p:
   - seed with 1..p-1
   - from each good n, test children n*p + d for d in [0, p-1]
3. Keep the maximum discovered good n.
4. For p=137, BFS terminates with:
   - M(137) = 4580726482872451
   - M(137) mod 99991 = 63128

Why this works:
- It does not assume any closed form for M(p).
- It proves maximality by exhaustive traversal of the finite reachable good set under n -> n*p + d.
- It avoids false extrapolation from finite linear scans.

## Wrong Approach 1 (2hudxy.txt - answer: 71577)
- Uses a sequential p-adic recurrence scan and finds local maximum at p^3 - 1 = 2571352.
- Checks around p^3 and then up to 10,000,000, but treats "no larger hit in this window" as global proof.
- Extrapolates unsupported rule M(p)=p^3-1 (known to fail for other primes, including p=7).
- Therefore returns 2571352 mod 99991 = 71577, which is wrong.

## Wrong Approach 2 (lgbi2q.txt - answer: 0)
- Explores many algebraic/digit-pattern heuristics without producing a validated computational method for p=137.
- Reaches unresolved contradictions, then switches to guess-based reasoning.
- Final output is an ungrounded guess (0), not derived from a correctness-preserving algorithm.
