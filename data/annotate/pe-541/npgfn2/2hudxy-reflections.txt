## Answer: wrong (71577)

## Key moments
- Token 5020 [insight]: Frames the goal as a p-adic integrality/divisibility condition for the lcm-scaled harmonic numerator.
- Token 10028 [breakthrough]: Moves away from giant exact fractions toward a p-adic valuation recurrence strategy.
- Token 17122 [questionable statement]: Keeps trusting a computation path even after obtaining a contradiction with the known \(M(3)=68\).
- Token 25068 [questionable statement]: Assumes \(a_n\) can be updated incrementally modulo \(p^K\) while the underlying lcm scale changes with \(n\).
- Token 30031 [wasted]: Spends substantial effort on speculative base-\(p\) digit-structure rules before the recurrence model is stabilized.
- Token 35079 [wasted]: Continues recursive/state reformulations that do not yet provide a trustworthy computable predicate.
- Token 44364 [mistake]: The incremental-update model is shown invalid because terms are mixed across different \(B_n\) scales, corrupting valuation tracking.
- Token 44916 [insight]: Explicitly abandons the broken \(A_n\)-increment approach.
- Token 45027 [breakthrough]: Recasts updates directly on reduced-fraction p-adic valuations via the harmonic recurrence.
- Token 50046-70171 [wasted]: Extended detour through pattern fitting and custom state constructions without a proven equivalence to the true denominator condition.
- Token 75246 [missed opportunity]: After substantial machinery, does not re-anchor quickly against the trusted \(M(7)=719102\) target before scaling to \(p=137\).
- Token 82305 [questionable statement]: Treats “largest zero seen in a finite scan” as a likely global \(M(p)\) candidate.
- Token 82432 [questionable statement]: Assumes \(e_{\max}\) for \(p=137\) is probably only 2 or 3, narrowing search expectations without proof.
- Token 83445 [verification]: Runs `find_M` to \(3\times10^6\) and records a local maximum at 2571352.
- Token 83716 [mistake]: Upgrades that local result to the global claim \(M(137)=p^3-1\) without a completeness argument.
- Token 84470 [questionable statement]: Uses an unsupported “after \(p^3\) it should always fail” heuristic from \(Z_0\)/\(e\)-reasoning.
- Token 84622 [verification]: Extends brute scan to \(10^7\), confirming only that no larger value appears in that finite window.
- Token 84723 [mistake]: Computes modulo 99991 and proceeds to finalize despite lacking proof that no good \(n\) exists beyond the scan cap.
- Token 85191 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{71577}`, which is wrong.
