## Answer: correct (404890862)

## Key moments
- Token 1374 [insight]: Uses parity on `T(T+2)=4\sum x_i^2` to force `T` even, then introduces `t=T/2`.
- Token 2493 [breakthrough]: Re-centers as `x_i=t/2+\delta_i`, deriving `\sum \delta_i=0` and `\sum \delta_i^2=t`, which gives the workable structural form.
- Token 9792 [insight]: Changes variables again (pair sums / `(a,b,c)` form) and gets `t=a^2+b^2+c^2` with linear ordering inequalities.
- Token 14532 [breakthrough]: Rewrites the objective as `S(n)=2\sum t` over valid triples and derives explicit bound checks used to build the counting algorithm.
- Token 24283 [questionable statement]: States that `c=0` yields no solutions, which is too broad and later conflicts with a missed valid branch.
- Token 31208-36704 [wasted]: Long complexity detour (asymptotics and loop-shape analysis) that does not materially change the final computational method.
- Token 39384 [mistake]: First implementation gives `S(5)=40` because the loop starts at `k=1`, omitting `k=0` cases.
- Token 40559 [breakthrough]: Identifies and adds the missing `k=0` branch; corrected implementation matches `S(5)=48` and `S(1000)=37048340`.
- Token 44321 [verification]: Verifies against brute-force results for small `n` and the provided checkpoint before finalizing.
- Token 44466 [final answer]: Commits `\boxed{404890862}`.
