## Answer: correct (59992576)

## Key moments
- Token 1074 [insight]: Reframes the game-ending condition as the first repeated winner across adjacent rounds.
- Token 2308 [questionable statement]: Overstates continuation behavior as if avoiding termination always means choosing the “new/right” player each round.
- Token 2818 [mistake]: Claims that for no early stop, intermediate rounds must all be right-wins; this ignores branches where a prior left-win still allows continuation.
- Token 4258 [breakthrough]: Introduces the independent `L/R` decision sequence and correctly characterizes stopping as first `RL` occurrence.
- Token 4946 [missed opportunity]: Recognizes this is a standard pattern-waiting problem but does not immediately use the direct closed-form derivation.
- Token 5219-7609 [wasted]: Extended back-and-forth on whether the waiting-time law is geometric before settling on a clean decomposition.
- Token 7872 [insight]: Decomposes by first position of `1` and subsequent run of `1`s before the first `0`.
- Token 8587 [breakthrough]: Derives \(f_i=(i-1)/2^i\) for first `10` ending at position \(i\), which unlocks summation by residue class.
- Token 8647 [verification]: Checks the formula against small \(i\) values and confirms agreement.
- Token 10147 [insight]: Factors the residue-class sum into an arithmetic-geometric form, preparing the closed-form simplification.
- Token 10967 [breakthrough]: Converts the series to closed form \(P_n(k)=2^{n-k}\big((k-1)(2^n-1)+n\big)/(2^n-1)^2\).
- Token 12983-15349 [wasted]: Long general-case gcd digression that is unnecessary for this instance once primality of \(n\) is established.
- Token 15349 [insight]: Identifies primality of \(n=100000007\) as the key shortcut for resolving reduction (\(d=1\)).
- Token 17751 [verification]: Validates the derived formulas against provided small examples (\(M_3(1)\), \(M_6(2)\)).
- Token 20745 [breakthrough]: Concludes \(d=1\) and final modular form \(M=2^{n-k}((k-1)(2^n-1)+n)(2^n-1)^2\) for this case.
- Token 21169 [verification]: Performs additional prime-\(n\) consistency checks before finalizing.
- Token 22885 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{59992576}\).
