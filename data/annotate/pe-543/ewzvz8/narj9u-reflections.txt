## Answer: correct (89776)

## Key moments
- Token 24 [insight]: Interprets `S(n)` as counting feasible `(i, k)` states, setting up a counting-based approach.
- Token 586-4514 [wasted]: Long additive-number-theory discussion (Goldbach variants and parity arguments) before extracting actionable counting structure.
- Token 4880 [questionable statement]: Assumes near-universal representability for `k>=2` via the `n>=2k` threshold.
- Token 6809 [mistake]: That assumption overcounts (`S(100)=2426` vs expected `2402`), proving the formula is wrong.
- Token 7176 [breakthrough]: Pinpoints the error source to `k=2` handling, especially odd values that are not `2 + prime`.
- Token 9734 [insight]: Re-expresses `S(n)` as `k=1` prime count + `k=2` special count + `k>=3` arithmetic block.
- Token 10493 [breakthrough]: Produces and tests a corrected general formula that matches provided checkpoints.
- Token 12215 [questionable statement]: Over-simplifies to a unified closed form without fully guarding small-`n` edge behavior.
- Token 13245 [mistake]: Edge-case test (`n=3`) exposes the unified form as incorrect.
- Token 13895 [breakthrough]: Repairs by separating small Fibonacci cases (`2,3,5`) from the `n>=6` formula path.
- Token 14078 [missed opportunity]: Spends substantial time debating segmented sieve vs Legendre vs Lehmer instead of implementing one path immediately.
- Token 14078-18247 [wasted]: Extended implementation-planning detour before committing to executable prime counting.
- Token 20442 [questionable statement]: Uses an incorrect algebraic simplification for the `\sum_{k=3}^{m}(n-2k+1)` term.
- Token 22721 [mistake]: Numeric check (`n=10`) shows the simplification is inconsistent.
- Token 23130 [breakthrough]: Re-derives the sum correctly as `m*(n-m)-2n+4`.
- Token 24136 [verification]: Brute-force comparison up to `n=200` confirms the final formula.
- Token 24398 [verification]: Recomputes the modulo sum independently for stability.
- Token 24906 [verification]: Confirms partial Fibonacci-range totals against brute force on the small prefix.
- Token 25588 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{89776}`.
