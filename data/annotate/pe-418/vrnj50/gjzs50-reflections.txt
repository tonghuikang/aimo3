## Answer: wrong (45151)

## Key moments
- Token 637 [questionable statement]: Suggests the optimum can be found by maximizing the smallest factor `a` (largest feasible `a` near `n^{1/3}`), which is not equivalent to maximizing `a^2 b`.
- Token 840 [insight]: Correctly states the true objective is maximizing `a^2 b` (equivalently minimizing `c/a`).
- Token 4201 [questionable statement]: Falls back to "balanced" greedy exponent assignment as likely sufficient for large `n`.
- Token 5275 [mistake]: Commits to the LPT-style greedy distribution as the working solver despite no exact-optimality guarantee.
- Token 11463 [insight]: Finds the `6!` counterexample showing greedy fails (`(6,10,12)` vs optimal `(8,9,10)`).
- Token 13111-21818 [wasted]: Spends a long span debugging/reshaping heuristics before cleanly locking onto a proof-grade objective-driven search.
- Token 21818 [breakthrough]: Moves to branch-and-bound style exact candidate search instead of relying on greedy balancing.
- Token 25443 [missed opportunity]: After seeing a failure case on `100100`, the trace fixes local search behavior but still does not re-center the global objective on maximizing `a^2 b` directly.
- Token 27017 [questionable statement]: Defines the branch-and-bound target as maximizing `best_a`.
- Token 27103 [mistake]: Implements pruning and selection around `best_a`, which can reject slightly smaller `a` values that yield larger `a^2 b` and better `c/a`.
- Token 29238 [mistake]: Treats agreement on examples/random small tests as sufficient validation for `43!`, despite the objective mismatch risk.
- Token 29814 [final answer]: Commits to `45151`, which is wrong.
