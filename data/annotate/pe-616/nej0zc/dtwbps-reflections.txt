## Answer: wrong (0)

## Key moments
- Token 225 [insight]: Models the game as closure on a perfect-power graph (compose and split transitions).
- Token 991 [questionable statement]: Treats finite decomposition trees as if they bound all future reachable primitives.
- Token 4899 [mistake]: Concludes immediately that creativity is impossible because non-perfect-powers are infinite.
- Token 8200-12200 [wasted]: Long detour on decomposition-tree formalism that does not resolve the key reachability gap.
- Token 16467 [questionable statement]: Assumes newly generated perfect powers cannot introduce genuinely new useful exponent nodes.
- Token 18898 [mistake]: Converts the finite-prime heuristic into a definitive “no creative integer” result.
- Token 17500 [missed opportunity]: Notices alternative decompositions of generated numbers but does not use them to challenge the invariant claim.
- Token 19364 [final answer]: Commits to `\\boxed{0}`.
