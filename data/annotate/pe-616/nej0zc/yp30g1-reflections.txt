## Key moments
- Token 3267 [insight]: Frames the game as a closure process over split/compose operations.
- Token 5181 [questionable statement]: Assumes reachable values are controlled by a fixed prime-support monoid.
- Token 5189 [mistake]: Immediately turns that assumption into a “no creative numbers” conclusion.
- Token 6500-9500 [wasted]: Repeats the same prime-support narrative without adding new evidence.
- Token 11197 [questionable statement]: Reasserts that missing primes can never be introduced, still without a complete proof.
- Token 12577 [mistake]: Uses the unresolved prime-invariance claim as the decisive final argument.
- Token 13000 [missed opportunity]: Skips a direct constructive stress test before finalizing.
- Token 13734 [final answer]: Commits to `\\boxed{0}`.
