## Key moments
- Token 206 [insight]: Sets up a closure-style view of what numbers can be reached by alternating split/compose moves.
- Token 3117 [questionable statement]: Assumes the reachable prime set is effectively fixed by early decomposition leaves.
- Token 5500-7300 [wasted]: Repeats small-cycle examples and local state loops without converting them into a general proof.
- Token 8956 [mistake]: Turns the finite-prime intuition into a universal impossibility claim for creativity.
- Token 12570 [questionable statement]: Uses bounded examples (`{2,3}`-style closures) as if they characterize the full infinite process.
- Token 12957 [mistake]: Concludes all starts are non-creative from those bounded closures, skipping needed rigor on generated exponents.
- Token 14150 [missed opportunity]: Does not validate the argument against alternative decomposition paths of newly generated perfect powers.
- Token 14778 [final answer]: Commits to `\\boxed{0}`.
