## Answer: wrong (0)

## Key moments
- Token 1017 [insight]: Sets up closure under exponentiation/decomposition as the main analytic lens.
- Token 3743 [questionable statement]: Assumes prime reachability is bounded by primes visible in initial split structure.
- Token 6500-10000 [wasted]: Extended duplicate/copy-state reasoning that does not produce a definitive criterion.
- Token 13454 [mistake]: Uses partial closure intuition to conclude all starts are non-creative.
- Token 19147 [questionable statement]: Claims reachable prime support stays confined to initial base/exponent prime factors.
- Token 21000 [mistake]: Converts that heuristic into a final impossibility statement.
- Token 21800 [missed opportunity]: Finishes with edge-condition checks instead of directly pressure-testing the central invariant.
- Token 22518 [final answer]: Commits to `\\boxed{0}`.
