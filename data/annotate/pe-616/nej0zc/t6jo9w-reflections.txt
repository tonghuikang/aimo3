## Answer: wrong (0)

## Key moments
- Token 2670 [insight]: Recognizes that non-perfect-power targets are the hard case and tries to reduce to primitive-number reachability.
- Token 3889 [questionable statement]: Builds a closure argument that assumes exponent-generation behavior is fully characterizable from that reduction.
- Token 6000-11000 [wasted]: Long primitive-set discussion and casework without resolving the core reachability gap.
- Token 15435 [questionable statement]: Claims the primitive set induced by `n` must already cover all needed primitives.
- Token 18898 [mistake]: Uses that claim to conclude no creative integers exist.
- Token 21000-24000 [wasted]: Adds a BFS/code-planning detour that is not integrated into the final proof.
- Token 24800 [mistake]: Repeats the impossibility conclusion after incomplete computational support.
- Token 25734 [final answer]: Commits to `\\boxed{0}`.
