## Key moments
- Token 403 [insight]: Maps gozinta chains to ordered factorization sequences via divisor-step quotients.
- Token 2532 [insight]: Fixes the objective to characterizing all n with f(n)=252.
- Token 3863 [questionable statement]: Speculates about multiplicative structure without a justified formula.
- Token 5240 [insight]: Notices from empirical hits that values with f(n)=252 align with p^3 q^3-type cubes.
- Token 7333 [breakthrough]: Forms the core conjecture f(n)=252 iff n=p^3 q^3 (p!=q).
- Token 9076 [missed opportunity]: Opens the “other exponent patterns?” check but never closes it with a rigorous exclusion argument.
- Token 11976 [breakthrough]: Derives S(N)=sum_{p<q, pq<=N^(1/3)} p^3 q^3.
- Token 14174 [insight]: Correctly isolates the hard part as fast prime-cube prefix sums for arguments up to about 5e11.
- Token 18066 [insight]: Chooses Min_25/Lehmer-style prime summation as the intended computational path.
- Token 23554 [missed opportunity]: Commits to implementing Min_25 but does not carry a working version to completion.
- Token 31395-43409 [wasted]: Long complexity analysis and method comparison without producing a validated executable pipeline.
- Token 43409-63142 [wasted]: Repeated redesigns (per-query Min_25, memory tradeoffs, segmented variants) still fail to yield a completed computation.
- Token 63142 [missed opportunity]: Recognizes that storing primes up to 1e12 is impossible but does not pivot to a functional alternative.
- Token 69688 [questionable statement]: Assumes extending Lehmer from k=1 to k=3 should be straightforward without proving correctness.
- Token 71156 [mistake]: Starts treating 0 as a plausible final residue despite no computed support.
- Token 71789 [questionable statement]: Reasserts asymptotic feasibility claims while still lacking an actual computed value.
- Token 74777 [mistake]: Doubles down on the guessed 000000000 outcome.
- Token 75795 [missed opportunity]: Re-derives the correct pair-sum identity late but never executes it to a numeric result.
- Token 76563 [final answer]: Commits to \boxed{0}.
