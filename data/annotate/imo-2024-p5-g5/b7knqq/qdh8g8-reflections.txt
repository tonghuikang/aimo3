## Answer: wrong (11)

## Key moments
- Token 724 [insight]: Correctly recognizes the invariant that exactly one column is globally monster-free.
- Token 1090 [missed opportunity]: Briefly notes a potential multi-column weaving strategy but does not develop it, defaulting back to pure safe-column search.
- Token 2421 [questionable statement]: Treats the task as necessarily “discover c* first, then use a final straight-down attempt,” which is stronger than required.
- Token 3042-3158 [wasted]: Spends substantial effort on contest-memory/speculation (possible closed-form guesses) instead of stress-testing the core assumptions on small cases.
- Token 9354 [questionable statement]: Claims guaranteed progress requires knowing each row’s monster column, effectively ruling out partial-information routing.
- Token 9630 [mistake]: Concludes that all (or all but one) monster placements must be identified before a guaranteed win is possible.
- Token 9741 [mistake]: Converts the above into the incorrect global formula f(k)=k+1.
- Token 10700 [mistake]: Reasserts f(k)=k+1 after additional discussion without constructing or checking a tighter strategy.
- Token 10816 [final answer]: Commits to \boxed{11}.
