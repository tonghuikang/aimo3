## Answer: wrong (11)

## Key moments
- Token 205 [insight]: Correctly identifies the core structural fact that exactly one column is monster-free.
- Token 514 [questionable statement]: Assumes the only practical winning plan is to first identify that globally safe column, rather than considering guaranteed zig-zag routing with partial information.
- Token 3269 [mistake]: Converts that assumption into a hard claim that worst-case must be k+1 attempts because discovery and winning must be separated.
- Token 3506-3915 [wasted]: Long elimination argument repeats the same “must fully identify safe column” framing without testing alternative constructions.
- Token 4002 [missed opportunity]: Raises the possibility of a clever sub-k+1 strategy but does not test small-k counterexamples (which would expose the over-strong lower bound).
- Token 8512 [questionable statement]: States a formal lower bound argument that each failed attempt effectively eliminates only one column toward an unavoidable k+1 total.
- Token 8724 [mistake]: Uses that flawed lower-bound setup to conclude f(k)=k+1.
- Token 9579 [questionable statement]: Proposes an adversary placement with all monsters in row 1, which violates the one-monster-per-row condition.
- Token 9652 [mistake]: Finalizes the incorrect general formula f(k)=k+1 from invalid lower-bound reasoning.
- Token 9796 [final answer]: Commits to \boxed{11}.
