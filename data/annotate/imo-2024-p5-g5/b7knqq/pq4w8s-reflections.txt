## Answer: correct (6)

## Key moments
- Token 106 [insight]: Correctly recognizes the structural invariant: k monsters occupy k distinct columns among k+1, so one globally monster-free column exists.
- Token 1506 [questionable statement]: Frames the search as essentially trying columns one-by-one with worst-case k+1 attempts, before proving whether richer pathing can beat that bound.
- Token 4052 [missed opportunity]: Starts a long information-theoretic lower-bound thread without leveraging the simpler row-by-row two-known-columns construction that later drives the final solution.
- Token 6315-6546 [wasted]: Extended detour arguing for k+1 attempts and testing speculative variants; this branch is later abandoned.
- Token 11747 [insight]: Identifies the key pivot that two discovered monster columns may already suffice to route safely through every row.
- Token 11988 [breakthrough]: Develops the concrete third-attempt routing idea using two known columns to cover each other’s blocked rows.
- Token 21126 [questionable statement]: Claims reliable horizontal switching is only guaranteed on top/bottom rows, which is too restrictive.
- Token 21651 [mistake]: Treats that restriction as a blocking condition for the third-attempt plan, creating unnecessary doubt about the already viable strategy.
- Token 23351 [breakthrough]: Fixes the routing concern by selecting shift rows not equal to either blocked row, restoring a valid guaranteed 3-attempt strategy.
- Token 24052 [verification]: Re-checks problem wording and assumptions (monster placement, movement, memory, attempt definition) before committing.
- Token 24478 [final answer]: Commits to f(4)=3 and f(5)=3, hence g(5)=6.
