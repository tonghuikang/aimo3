Correct answer: g(5) = 6.

Key lemma for this family:
- For k >= 4, f(k) = 3.

Proof of lemma (complete):

Lower bound f(k) >= 3:
- Assume a strategy claims guaranteed success in at most 2 attempts.
- In attempt 1, let c be the first column where Turbo enters row 2.
  - Put the row-2 monster at (row 2, c), so attempt 1 fails there.
- In attempt 2, Turbo must enter row 3 at some column d to have any chance to reach the bottom.
  - Since row 2, column c is blocked, d != c.
  - Put the row-3 monster at (row 3, d), so attempt 2 fails when entering row 3.
- Assign monsters in all remaining interior rows to distinct unused columns (possible because remaining rows = k-2, remaining columns = k-1).
- So no strategy can guarantee success in 2 attempts.

Upper bound f(k) <= 3:
- Attempt 1: go straight down any column A.
  - If no monster, win.
  - Else discover (rA, A).
- Attempt 2: go straight down a different column B.
  - If no monster, win.
  - Else discover (rB, B), with rA != rB and A != B.
- Then A is safe in all interior rows except rA, and B is safe in all interior rows except rB.
- Attempt 3 route:
  - If |rA-rB| >= 2, switch between A and B on an intermediate row where both are safe.
  - If |rA-rB| = 1, use a bridge column C not in {A, B}; this exists because k+1 >= 5.
  - In both cases, route from top to bottom while avoiding A at row rA and avoiding B at row rB.
- Therefore 3 attempts always suffice.

Hence f(k) = 3 for k >= 4.

Now compute:
- g(5) = f(4) + f(5) = 3 + 3 = 6.

Wrong approach to reject:
- "Turbo must discover every monster column before a guaranteed win, so f(k)=k+1."
- Why wrong: after two discovered monster columns, a guaranteed third-attempt route already exists.
