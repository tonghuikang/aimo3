## Answer: correct (76246)

## Key moments
- Token 35 [insight]: Frames the target as controlling prime factors of `n(n+1)/2` to be at most 47.
- Token 1880 [insight]: Writes the explicit even/odd factorizations, exposing the exact smoothness constraints on paired factors.
- Token 2157 [breakthrough]: Derives the parity split into `(a, 2a+1)` and `(a+1, 2a+1)` smoothness conditions.
- Token 3138 [insight]: Recasts the parity constraints as candidate families `n=2a` and `n=2a+1`, preparing linear-equation reduction.
- Token 3620 [breakthrough]: Compresses both branches into the linear S-unit form `b - 2c = ±1` with smooth `b,c`.
- Token 3819-17430 [wasted]: Long sequence of reformulations and theory discussion without executing a scalable complete search.
- Token 7448 [questionable statement]: Estimates smooth-number volume as prohibitively large, suggesting brute-force-style enumeration is impractical.
- Token 7539 [mistake]: Concludes direct enumeration is infeasible based on that estimate, delaying a workable approach.
- Token 10713-14137 [wasted]: Additional high-level strategy cycling continues before validating real candidate counts.
- Token 17703 [insight]: Starts empirical counting of odd smooth candidates to test whether the search space is truly prohibitive.
- Token 18827 [breakthrough]: Implements explicit odd-smooth counting and finds manageable candidate sizes in practice.
- Token 19000 [insight]: Confirms counts up to 1e9 remain tractable, supporting an exhaustive computational route.
- Token 19239 [breakthrough]: Confirms 1e12-scale odd-smooth enumeration is tractable, enabling exhaustive computational checks.
- Token 20054 [verification]: First full run at `1e12` yields 1501 candidates and establishes the end-to-end solver behavior.
- Token 20421 [verification]: Extending to `1e14` raises count to 1502 with max `n = 1109496723125`.
- Token 20582 [verification]: Extending to `1e16` keeps count/max unchanged, supporting saturation.
- Token 21007-21401 [wasted]: Side attempt to reason via larger-count extrapolation adds runtime but no new information.
- Token 22203 [verification]: Streaming DFS re-check up to `1e16`, `2e16`, and `1e17` still returns 1502 and same maximum.
- Token 22833 [verification]: Computes final total sum `2,227,616,372,734` before modulo reduction.
- Token 22876 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{76246}`.
