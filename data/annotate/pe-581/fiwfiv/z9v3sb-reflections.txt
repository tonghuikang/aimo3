## Answer: wrong (8209)

## Key moments
- Token 165 [insight]: Recognizes that dividing by 2 cannot remove primes >47, so large primes in either neighbor would survive into T(n).
- Token 3389 [breakthrough]: Reframes the search around odd smooth values tied to 2x±1 structure, turning the problem into an enumerable smooth-number condition.
- Token 3495-6050 [wasted]: Long speculation about finiteness/S-unit theory and bounds does not produce an actionable correctness test.
- Token 5173 [questionable statement]: States the odd branch as needing consecutive smooth a and a+1, adding an unnecessary constraint.
- Token 7475 [mistake]: Implements odd-solution collection only inside `if a is smooth`, so odd n are filtered by an extra condition that the math does not require.
- Token 7725 [missed opportunity]: Accepts the 744/128 split (872 total) without running an independent odd-case check `a+1 smooth` for all odd smooth v.
- Token 12059 [questionable statement]: Introduces a smoothness test that breaks when `p*p > num`, which can reject valid remaining prime factors.
- Token 12603 [mistake]: The flawed `is_smooth` path yields an inconsistent total (mod 2300), creating incorrect intermediate conclusions.
- Token 14698 [insight]: Identifies that leftover allowed primes (e.g., primes greater than the running square-root cutoff) are being rejected by the smoothness predicate.
- Token 15029 [breakthrough]: Diagnoses and patches the `is_smooth` logic, recovering consistency of that computation path.
- Token 17248-19011 [wasted]: Multiple timeout-heavy rewrites and performance detours repeat the same constrained odd-case logic instead of fixing the criterion.
- Token 22760 [questionable statement]: Treats unchanged results up to 1e15 as sufficient proof of completeness without validating the odd-case predicate itself.
- Token 22794 [mistake]: Commits to `331571164118` as the global sum despite the structural undercount from the nested odd-condition filter.
- Token 23953 [missed opportunity]: Final correction effort focuses on adding n=1 rather than re-checking missing odd indices from the model setup.
- Token 25221 [final answer]: Commits to 8209 (after +1 adjustment), which remains wrong because many valid odd indices were never included.
