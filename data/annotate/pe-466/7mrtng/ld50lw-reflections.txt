## Answer: wrong (39568)

## Key moments
- Token 428 [insight]: Correctly reframes representability as existence of a divisor `i` in `[ceil(k/n), 64]`.
- Token 2329 [questionable statement]: Suggests the blockwise complement is just numbers whose prime factors are all `> L-1`, which is too coarse for the actual divisor-interval condition.
- Token 2357 [mistake]: Commits to a rough-number block model from that simplification, establishing a faulty counting basis.
- Token 5974 [insight]: Properly partitions the problem into intervals `((t-1)n, tn]` with required divisors in `[t,64]`.
- Token 15698 [missed opportunity]: Chooses direct high-branching inclusion-exclusion recursion instead of moving immediately to compressed lcm-coefficient aggregation.
- Token 15698-19865 [wasted]: Extended recursion/pruning attempts consume effort without yielding a stable scalable computation route.
- Token 20438 [insight]: Identifies that subset contributions should be aggregated by lcm values, a key compression idea.
- Token 23596-26820 [wasted]: Long Möbius/periodicity detour does not produce a correct end-to-end formula.
- Token 27012 [insight]: Introduces minimal-generator reduction in `[t,64]`, a useful structural simplification.
- Token 35039 [insight]: Recognizes repeated-lcm structure and moves toward memoized coefficient accumulation.
- Token 41761 [missed opportunity]: Finds a concrete counterexample (smooth part `s=82` at `t=50`) disproving the critical `s>=t` implication, but the correction is not propagated into the final derivation.
- Token 49278 [breakthrough]: Implements fast memoized recursion for `R(x)` (64-rough counts), enabling full-size execution.
- Token 54468 [questionable statement]: Final decomposition implicitly restricts admissible smooth factors to `s<t`, reintroducing an unproven/invalid constraint.
- Token 54599 [mistake]: States that `s>=t` forces a divisor in `[t,64]`; this is false and removes valid missing-number cases.
- Token 55023 [mistake]: Uses the truncated formula `U = sum_{t=2}^{64} sum_{s=1}^{t-1} (...)`, inheriting the bad `s<t` restriction and undercounting missing values.
- Token 55339 [final answer]: Commits to the wrong boxed result `39568`.
