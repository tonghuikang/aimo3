## Problem-Level Structure
- Cost `1` occurs exactly for inverse pairs modulo `p`.
- Most vertices in an optimal pairing stay in inverse pairs (cost `1`); the nontrivial part is rerouting around the self-inverses `1` and `-1`.
- A useful global view is an alternating rerouting chain from `1` to `-1`; only edges on that chain have non-`1` costs.
- If the non-`1` costs are `r_1, ..., r_k` (each `>= 2`), then:
  - `r_1 * ... * r_k ≡ -1 (mod p)`
  - total sum is `(p-1)/2 + Σ(r_i - 1)`
- So minimizing total cost is equivalent to minimizing `Σ(r_i - 1)` subject to the product congruence.

## For p = 2,000,000,011
- The minimizing non-`1` multiset is:
  - `2^7, 3, 5, 11^4, 13, 17^4, 19^2, 23, 53`
- Therefore the optimal cost product is:
  - `2^7 * 3 * 5 * 11^4 * 13 * 17^4 * 19^2 * 23 * 53`
  - `= 13431419535872807040`

## Common Wrong Approaches
- Assuming the product is always `p-1` from small-prime patterns.
  - This fails for other primes; small-case extrapolation is unreliable.
- Over-restricting to powers of `2` / order-of-`2` arguments.
  - Mixed small factors can yield strictly smaller `Σ(r_i - 1)`.
- Optimizing smoothness of numbers of the form `p*t - 1` without preserving matching feasibility.
  - This proxy is not equivalent to the original matching optimization and can produce wrong products.
