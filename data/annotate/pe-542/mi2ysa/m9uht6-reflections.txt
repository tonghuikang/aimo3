## Key moments
- Token 97 [insight]: Correctly frames integer GP constraints and allows rational common ratio.
- Token 490 [breakthrough]: Derives the canonical integer-term form `t * p^i * q^{m-1-i}`.
- Token 1173 [breakthrough]: Writes the optimization target `S(k)=max floor(k/p^{m-1}) * (p^m-q^m)/(p-q)`.
- Token 6665 [insight]: Detects empirical preference for consecutive pairs (`q=p-1`) in tested small ranges.
- Token 12599 [insight]: Identifies the key tradeoff between larger length and feasible base size.
- Token 21060 [breakthrough]: Simplifies to the consecutive-ratio family, reducing the search dimension.
- Token 30729 [insight]: Estimates the effective slope ceiling (`~15` at `10^17`) to bound candidate complexity.
- Token 39780 [questionable statement]: Assumes evaluating near `p_max` is generally sufficient for selecting optimal candidates.
- Token 40660 [mistake]: Counterexample (`k=45`) shows the near-`p_max` heuristic fails; smaller `p` with larger multiplier wins.
- Token 44649-49874 [wasted]: Extended speculative modeling without converging to a correct executable method.
- Token 49874 [insight]: Tries to switch from asymptotic speculation to explicit interval/change analysis.
- Token 55887 [questionable statement]: Assumes low-`t` families can be discarded beyond a heuristic cutoff without a proof.
- Token 63176 [mistake]: Encounters inconsistent outputs across settings and never establishes a sound correction.
- Token 69450 [missed opportunity]: Does not pivot to a fully validated algorithm despite repeated inconsistency signals.
- Token 74147 [questionable statement]: Treats per-family alternating contributions additively as if `S(k)` were a sum, ignoring the `max` operator.
- Token 76098 [mistake]: Realizes the additive decomposition is invalid only after spending significant effort on it.
- Token 77052-81253 [wasted]: Long sequence of heuristic extrapolations and pattern guesses instead of verified computation.
- Token 82404 [missed opportunity]: After explicit user pushback against placeholders/guesses, still fails to recover a validated path.
- Token 84917 [final answer]: Commits to `0` without a correct derivation.
