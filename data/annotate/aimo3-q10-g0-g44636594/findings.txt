## Correct answer: 1165

## Problem summary
For `n >= 6`, `f(n)` is the smallest integer having three distinct divisors that sum to `n`.  
With `M = 3^{2025!}`, define
`g(c) = floor(2025! * f(M+c) / M) / 2025!`.
Need `(p+q) mod 99991` where
`g(0) + g(44636594) = p/q` in lowest terms.

## Correct approach
1. Rewrite `f(n)` as minimizing `lcm(a,b,c)` over distinct positive integers `a,b,c` with `a+b+c=n`.
2. For `n = M`, the optimal ratio is `f(M)/M = 2/3`, so `g(0)=2/3`.
3. For `n = M+44636594`, reduce feasibility to divisor-conditioned ratio candidates and use divisors of `c+1 = 44636595 = 3*5*103*167*173`.
4. The best feasible branch is `110/167`, giving `g(44636594)=110/167`.
5. Then
`g(0)+g(44636594) = 2/3 + 110/167 = 664/501`.
So `p+q = 664+501 = 1165`, and modulo `99991` is still `1165`.

## Wrong approaches seen in traces
1. **Wrong answer 23**: treats a `6/11`-type formula as universally optimal for `M+c`, so it sets the second term to `6/11` and gets `2/3 + 6/11 = 40/33`, hence `p+q=23`.
2. **Wrong answer 73**: similarly locks onto the same wrong `6/11` branch for `M+44636594`, yielding `40/33` and `p+q=73`.

## Why those wrong approaches fail
1. They do not enforce the actual divisibility feasibility for the chosen ratio branch against `M+44636594`.
2. They skip the decisive divisor search that exposes the `167` branch with ratio `110/167`.
3. Their verification only checks floor arithmetic after assuming the wrong `f(M+c)/M` ratio.
