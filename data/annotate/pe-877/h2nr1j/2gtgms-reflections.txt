## Answer: correct (17095)

## Key moments
- Token 865 [insight]: Reframes XOR-product as GF(2) polynomial multiplication, enabling a coefficient-level attack instead of bit-by-bit simulation.
- Token 1193 [breakthrough]: Establishes the core identity `a(x)^2 ⊕ x a(x)b(x) ⊕ b(x)^2 = 1 + x^2`, which sets up all later structural deductions.
- Token 4204 [insight]: Uses injectivity and image properties of the squaring map in `GF(2)[x]` to constrain what forms can appear on the right-hand side.
- Token 4680 [breakthrough]: Derives the key structural condition that `a ⊗ b` must contain only odd-degree monomials.
- Token 11241-16040 [wasted]: Long detour through abstract factorization/classification ideas without yielding a concrete next-term construction.
- Token 17633-24012 [wasted]: Continues symbolic reformulations and speculative parameterizations instead of moving to a constructive recurrence.
- Token 25884 [missed opportunity]: Brute-force data already suggests a unique consecutive solution chain, but the trace does not pivot immediately to exploiting that structure.
- Token 33049 [missed opportunity]: Begins candidate-generation thinking before fully locking the full coefficient constraints, causing another round of rework.
- Token 37688-45434 [wasted]: Extended linear-system experimentation stalls on handling the optimization criterion (minimal valid solution greater than current term).
- Token 45434 [insight]: Recognizes the affine-solution/nullspace viewpoint, which is the right lens for selecting constrained next terms.
- Token 54480 [insight]: Commits to a full linear-system approach for next-term generation, a productive shift from ad hoc pattern-hunting.
- Token 58947 [questionable statement]: Uses `(m-1)` as the shifted degree index inside the `x^2` term, which is an indexing mismatch.
- Token 60226 [mistake]: From that indexing error, concludes `b2=0` for `a=24`, contradicting the known valid pair `(24,63)`.
- Token 61834 [insight]: Rechecks degree bookkeeping under the shift and identifies that the correct index is `2m-2`.
- Token 62151 [breakthrough]: Corrects the recurrence to `b_m = u_{m-1} ⊕ Σ_{i+j=2m-2} u_i b_j`, which makes the chain solver work.
- Token 65980 [verification]: Validates `X(10)=5`, matching the problem’s provided checkpoint.
- Token 66536 [verification]: Brute-force validation up to `N=5000` matches the generated chain, supporting completeness in tested range.
- Token 66770 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{17095}`.
