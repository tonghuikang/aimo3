## Answer: correct (17095)

## Key moments
- Token 62 [insight]: Correctly models XOR-product as polynomial multiplication over `GF(2)`, enabling algebraic manipulation.
- Token 1085 [breakthrough]: Rewrites the equation as `A(x^2) + B(x^2) + xA(x)B(x) = 1 + x^2`, establishing the core symbolic form.
- Token 6281 [questionable statement]: Infers overly strict parity-factor conditions from `s_even=0`, assuming only separated-parity families can satisfy the product constraints.
- Token 8446 [mistake]: Commits to that parity-family restriction and reaches contradiction at the `i=1` condition, invalidating the branch.
- Token 10905 [insight]: Uses the known solution `(3,6)` to show mixed-parity supports can still satisfy `s_even=0` via cancellation.
- Token 11495 [breakthrough]: Drops the over-restrictive family classification and returns to the full linear constraint system.
- Token 14819-17655 [wasted]: Long recurrence-guessing and ratio hunting from small samples without a constructive next-term solver.
- Token 17696 [insight]: Identifies empirical chain structure where each solution’s `b` becomes the next solution’s `a`.
- Token 18182 [missed opportunity]: Continues speculative closed-form pattern search instead of immediately implementing the already-available linear solve approach.
- Token 22431-27000 [wasted]: Extended binary-pattern/base-mapping speculation without reducing computational uncertainty.
- Token 27000 [missed opportunity]: Keeps pursuing symbolic/format patterns after observing a practical “solve next b from linear equations” path.
- Token 32480 [insight]: Recognizes that with fixed `a`, all constraints are linear in bits of `b`, making Gaussian elimination viable.
- Token 42050 [breakthrough]: Commits to per-step linear-system solving (with bit-length constraint) to compute the unique next chain term efficiently.
- Token 46723 [verification]: Tests the solver on known early transitions and reproduces the observed chain behavior.
- Token 47029 [verification]: Confirms the checkpoint `X(10)=5` and computes the large-`N` candidate value.
- Token 47401 [verification]: Performs extra-solution checks to support the claim that relevant solutions are exactly the chain terms.
- Token 50706 [insight]: Clarifies that linear systems can admit lower solutions, but the unique solution with `b>a` is the chain successor.
- Token 51263 [verification]: Recomputes and stabilizes the final modulo result.
- Token 51699 [final answer]: Finalizes `\boxed{17095}`.
