## Answer: correct (14)

## Key moments
- Token 24 [insight]: Starts from the key structural reduction that α is supported only on indices \(0,1,2\).
- Token 1594 [insight]: Uses shift invariance to normalize the target to two spikes at \(\{0,d\}\), simplifying parameter handling.
- Token 2324-3404 [wasted]: Re-derives the same recurrence/convolution setup multiple times without adding a new necessary condition.
- Token 3778 [breakthrough]: Moves to the group-ring/polynomial identity \(\alpha(x)\gamma(x)=1+x^d\), enabling divisor classification.
- Token 12385 [insight]: Enumerates low-degree cyclotomic candidates, framing the finite case split.
- Token 12618 [questionable statement]: Keeps \(\pm(x^2+x+1)\) in the candidate list for divisors of \(1+x^d\).
- Token 13111 [mistake]: Concludes the count is 16 from that over-broad candidate set.
- Token 19405 [questionable statement]: Repeats the same unsupported inclusion of \(x^2+x+1\) in the degree-2 allowed class.
- Token 19481 [mistake]: Recomputes with the bad class and again gets \(6+4+6=16\).
- Token 21561 [breakthrough]: Correctly excludes \(x^2+x+1\) via \(1+\omega^d\neq 0\) for cube roots, fixing the class to \(\pm1,\pm(x+1),\pm(x^2+1),\pm(x^2-x+1)\).
- Token 23002-26830 [missed opportunity]: After correcting the count, spends a long extra cycle re-arguing and planning brute-force checks instead of finalizing sooner.
- Token 27514 [verification]: Brute-force divisibility search over bounded coefficients returns exactly the 14 expected triples.
- Token 27933 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{14}\).
