## Answer: correct (14)

## Key moments
- Token 21 [insight]: Immediately reduces \(\alpha\) to a triple \((a_0,a_1,a_2)\) supported on \(\{0,1,2\}\).
- Token 669-1652 [wasted]: Spends a long interval repeatedly restating convolution/recurrence forms before introducing a stronger structural constraint.
- Token 1716 [breakthrough]: Moves to the polynomial model \(A(x)B(x)=x^k+x^l\), which converts the problem to divisibility in \(\mathbb{Z}[x,x^{-1}]\).
- Token 3255 [insight]: Normalizes the target to \(x^d+1\) (up to monomial shift), clarifying that only low-degree divisors matter.
- Token 6220 [questionable statement]: Temporarily treats \(x^2+x+1\) as a possible degree-2 divisor class for \(x^d+1\).
- Token 7002 [breakthrough]: Correctly rules out \(x^2+x+1\), leaving only \(\pm1\), \(\pm(x+1)\), \(\pm(x^2+1)\), \(\pm(x^2-x+1)\).
- Token 10136 [insight]: Completes the shift-by-degree counting argument \(6+4+4=14\).
- Token 11803 [verification]: Performs a bounded brute-force divisibility search and recovers exactly the same 14 triples.
- Token 13573 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{14}\).
