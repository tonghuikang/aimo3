## Answer: correct (14)

## Key moments
- Token 156 [insight]: Identifies the support constraint immediately, reducing α to an integer triple on indices \(0,1,2\).
- Token 1757 [insight]: Re-indexes the condition into a linear recurrence/convolution form \(a_0\beta_m+a_1\beta_{m+1}+a_2\beta_{m+2}=g(m)\), which sets up an algebraic treatment.
- Token 2147-3403 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch repeatedly reformulating the convolution viewpoint without adding a new restriction on \(\alpha\).
- Token 3690 [insight]: Switches to generating polynomials \(A(x),B(x),G(x)\), enabling divisibility reasoning.
- Token 4268 [breakthrough]: Derives \(A(x)B(x)=x^k+x^l=x^k(1+x^d)\), turning the task into classifying degree-\(\le 2\) factors (up to monomial shift/sign) of \(1+x^d\).
- Token 5525 [breakthrough]: Narrows candidates to degree-\(\le 2\) cyclotomic-type divisors, which makes the count finite and explicit.
- Token 9530 [missed opportunity]: After the classification is already complete, continues extended re-check loops instead of finalizing earlier.
- Token 15054 [verification]: Runs a brute-force computational check over bounded coefficients and confirms the same 14 candidate triples.
- Token 16232 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{14}\).
