## Answer: wrong (8)

## Key moments
- Token 272 [insight]: Correctly reduces \(\alpha\) to support inside \(\{0,1,2\}\), i.e., a triple \((a_0,a_1,a_2)\).
- Token 2352 [breakthrough]: Introduces generating functions and the product form \(A(x)D(x)=x^k+x^l\), which is the right algebraic framework.
- Token 3105 [questionable statement]: Treats the condition as direct divisibility \(A(x)\mid (1+x^t)\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\), instead of first separating monomial units (Laurent-shift freedom).
- Token 3964 [mistake]: Uses that stronger-than-needed reduction as necessary and sufficient, which incorrectly rules out valid \(A(x)=x\), \(x^2\), and \(x(x+1)\)-type cases.
- Token 13220 [questionable statement]: Claims \(a_0\neq 0\) (indeed \(a_0=\pm1\)) is necessary for shifty functions, directly inheriting the same flawed divisibility assumption.
- Token 13712 [mistake]: Finalizes the restricted count as 8 based on the invalid \(a_0\neq 0\)-only class.
- Token 17333-18103 [missed opportunity]: Considers doing a direct shifty-condition brute-force check but does not actually execute that stronger test.
- Token 20839-21503 [missed opportunity]: Runs a bounded divisibility search tied to the wrong criterion, so the “confirmation” reinforces the earlier modeling error.
- Token 21508 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{8}\).
