## Answer: correct (14)

## Key moments
- Token 233 [insight]: Correctly encodes \(\alpha\) as a length-3 integer sequence supported on \(\{0,1,2\}\).
- Token 876-1655 [wasted]: Repeats correlation/convolution interpretation several times before introducing a sharper algebraic condition.
- Token 1671 [breakthrough]: Converts the condition to the Laurent-polynomial equation \(A(x)B(x)=x^k+x^l\).
- Token 3035 [insight]: Reframes the target as \(x^{\min(k,l)}(1+x^d)\), isolating the key divisor \(1+x^d\).
- Token 6481 [breakthrough]: Identifies the relevant low-degree factor classes (with monomial shifts/sign), giving the right finite candidate family.
- Token 12316 [insight]: Completes the combinatorial count by degree/shift constraints, yielding \(6+4+4=14\).
- Token 15054 [verification]: Runs a bounded brute-force search over coefficients and \(d\), confirming no extra patterns beyond the 14-class list.
- Token 16232 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{14}\).
