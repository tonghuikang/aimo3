Correct answer: 14

Correct approach:
- Let \(A(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2\) represent \(\alpha\) (support in \(\{0,1,2\}\)).
- Rewrite the condition \(S_n(\alpha)\star\beta\) as a Laurent-polynomial product:
  \(A(x)B(x)=x^k+x^l=x^k(1+x^d)\), where \(d=|l-k|>0\), and \(B\in\mathbb{Z}[x,x^{-1}]\).
- Write \(A(x)=x^qD(x)\) with \(q\in\{0,1,2\}\), \(D(0)\neq 0\). Then \(D\) must divide \(1+x^d\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\).
- Degree-\(\le 2\) possibilities for \(D\) that divide some \(1+x^d\):
  - \(\pm1\)
  - \(\pm(x+1)\) (when \(d\) odd)
  - \(\pm(x^2+1)\) (when \(d\equiv2\pmod4\))
  - \(\pm(x^2-x+1)\) (when \(d\equiv3\pmod6\))
- Count by allowed shifts \(q\) under degree \(\le2\):
  - \(\pm1\): \(q=0,1,2\) -> 6
  - \(\pm(x+1)\): \(q=0,1\) -> 4
  - \(\pm(x^2+1),\pm(x^2-x+1)\): \(q=0\) -> 4
  - Total \(6+4+4=14\).

Equivalent valid \(\alpha\)-tuples:
- \((\pm1,0,0),(0,\pm1,0),(0,0,\pm1)\)
- \((\pm1,\pm1,0),(0,\pm1,\pm1)\) with matching signs
- \((\pm1,0,\pm1)\) with matching signs
- \((1,-1,1),(-1,1,-1)\)

Wrong approach 1 (gives 8):
- Incorrectly require \(A(x)\) itself (not \(A=x^qD\)) to divide \(1+x^d\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\).
- This wrongly excludes valid monomial-shift cases with \(a_0=0\), e.g. \(x\), \(x^2\), \(x(x+1)\), and their negatives.

Wrong approach 2 (gives 16):
- Incorrectly include \(x^2+x+1\) as a divisor of \(1+x^d\).
- But \(x^2+x+1=\Phi_3\) never divides \(1+x^d\) for integer \(d\), so adding \(\pm(x^2+x+1)\) overcounts by 2.
