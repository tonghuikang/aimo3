## Problem Summary
Scatterstone Nim on partitions of `n`: a move splits one pile of size `s>=2` into `p` nonempty piles with `2<=p<=k`. A position is winning iff the XOR of pile Grundy numbers is nonzero.

## Correct Answer
`g(200) = 626616617 (mod 1e9+7)`

## Correct Approach
1. For fixed `k`, compute single-pile Grundy values:
   - `G_k(1)=0`
   - `G_k(s)=mex{ XOR of child Grundies over all valid splits of s }`
2. Count partitions of `n` by XOR using partition DP:
   - `dp[sum][xor]` = number of unordered partitions of `sum` with total Grundy XOR `xor`
   - Standard unbounded-partition transition over part size `i`:
     `dp[t][x ^ G_k(i)] += dp[t-i][x]`
   - `f(n,k) = sum_{xor!=0} dp[n][xor]`
3. Key structural simplification:
   - `k=2`: parity Grundy (`G_2(s)=1` for even `s`, `0` for odd `s`)
   - `k=3`: nontrivial sequence (must be computed)
   - `k>=4`: `G_k(s)=s-1` for all `s>=2`
4. Therefore:
   - `g(n)=f(n,2)+f(n,3)+(n-3)*f(n,4)`

## Values For n=200
- `f(200,2) = 499344328`
- `f(200,3) = 141964997`
- `f(200,4) = 644595473`
- `g(200) = 499344328 + 141964997 + 197*644595473 (mod 1e9+7) = 626616617`

## Verification Targets
- `f(5,2)=3`
- `f(5,3)=5`
- `g(7)=66`
- `g(10)=291`

## Wrong Approaches And Why They Fail
- Assuming `k=3` is already in the unrestricted regime (`G(s)=s-1`): false. `k=3` has a different Grundy sequence, so this gives wrong `f(200,3)` and wrong final `g(200)`.
- Treating all `k=2..200` as unrelated and recomputing full heavy machinery for each without the `k>=4` collapse: computationally wasteful and obscures the core structure.
- Guessing simple closed forms for `k=3` Grundy values (e.g., naive linear/mod patterns) without validation: produces incorrect XOR classification of partitions.
