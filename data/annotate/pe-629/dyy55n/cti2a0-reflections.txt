## Answer: correct (626616617)

## Key moments
- Token 299 [insight]: Correctly reduces the game objective to counting integer partitions whose pile-Grundy XOR is nonzero.
- Token 1154 [questionable statement]: Speculates unsupported Grundy-growth rules (`floor(log2 s)`, `floor(s/2)`) before collecting evidence.
- Token 8204 [insight]: Identifies that `G_k(s)` should be monotone in `k`, which later helps reason about thresholds.
- Token 12224 [missed opportunity]: Continues planning an all-`k` brute-force pipeline despite signs that structural simplification is needed.
- Token 13249-21641 [wasted]: Long complexity/architecture detour exploring heavy all-`k` DP variants without producing the target value.
- Token 22144 [insight]: Pivots to directly test the unrestricted-split case to search for a closed-form Grundy pattern.
- Token 22538 [breakthrough]: Empirically finds unrestricted Grundy values `G(s)=s-1`.
- Token 23912 [insight]: Verifies the same behavior already holds at `k=4` (while `k=3` differs), revealing the practical threshold.
- Token 24302 [breakthrough]: Collapses the sum to `g(n)=f(n,2)+f(n,3)+(n-3)f(n,4)`.
- Token 25575 [verification]: Checks the reduced formula against provided examples (`g(7)=66`, `g(10)=291`).
- Token 26896 [verification]: Finalizes the three-case implementation plan (`k=2`, `k=3`, and `k>=4`).
- Token 29070 [verification]: Runs the final computation for `n=200` and gets `626616617`.
- Token 29838 [final answer]: Commits `\boxed{626616617}` (correct).
