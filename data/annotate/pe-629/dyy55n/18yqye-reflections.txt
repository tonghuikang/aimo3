## Answer: correct (626616617)

## Key moments
- Token 843 [insight]: Hypothesizes that for sufficiently large `k`, the heap Grundy values may simplify to `G(s)=s-1`.
- Token 6210 [verification]: Checks `k=4` up to `s=200` and finds no mismatches against `s-1`.
- Token 6525 [breakthrough]: Uses the `k>=4` behavior to reduce the full sum to three cases (`k=2,3,4`).
- Token 6684 [verification]: Confirms the multiplier for `k=4..200` is `197`, resolving the term count correctly.
- Token 10313 [verification]: Computes the core values `f2=499344328`, `f3=141964997`, `f4=644595473`.
- Token 10766 [verification]: Validates against all provided checks (`f(5,2)=3`, `f(5,3)=5`, `g(7)=66`, `g(10)=291`).
- Token 11253 [missed opportunity]: Keeps exploring near-complete direct recomputation over `k=2..200` after the reduction is already validated.
- Token 11702-13405 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch on repeated sanity checks and recomputations that do not change the result.
- Token 12540 [questionable statement]: Writes `zero_cnt mod?` as if it were valid Python syntax.
- Token 12540 [mistake]: Triggers an execution failure and extra recovery steps due to that invalid line.
- Token 12609 [insight]: Recognizes the failed run left missing state and that the parity-check needs a clean recomputation.
- Token 13035 [breakthrough]: Rebuilds the helper and confirms `total - zero_cnt == f2`, restoring end-to-end consistency.
- Token 13565 [final answer]: Commits `\boxed{626616617}` (correct).
