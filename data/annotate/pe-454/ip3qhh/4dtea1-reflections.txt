## Answer: wrong (0)

## Key moments
- Token 99 [insight]: Rewrites the equation into factor-pair form, setting up the divisor-based counting perspective.
- Token 2026 [breakthrough]: States the useful constrained formula \(F(L)=\sum_n \#\{d\mid n^2: n<d\le L-n\}\), which is the right structural target.
- Token 2371 [questionable statement]: Assumes every divisor \(d>n\) of \(n^2\) can be written as \(d=nk\) with integer \(k\mid n\), which is not generally true.
- Token 3166 [mistake]: Commits to the incorrect closed form \(\sum_{k\ge2}\lfloor L/(k(k+1))\rfloor\), derived from the false divisor parameterization.
- Token 3440 [verification]: Runs a check against \(F(15)=4\), which productively exposes that the new formula gives the wrong count.
- Token 4335 [breakthrough]: Uses the concrete counterexample \((x,y,n)=(10,15,6)\) to locate and fix the bad assumption about divisors being multiples of \(n\).
- Token 5868-13332 [wasted]: Long reparameterization detour over \(b\), squarefree kernels, and equivalent forms without producing a computable end-to-end algorithm.
- Token 14706 [missed opportunity]: Derives additional case formulas but does not consolidate them into a concrete complexity-bounded computation plan.
- Token 19627-47219 [wasted]: Repeatedly restates Möbius/hyperbola-style transforms and symbolic sums, but keeps cycling between equivalent representations.
- Token 28498 [insight]: Derives a compact `C(d)` expression, indicating an attempt to turn symbolic transforms into a countable summand.
- Token 33782 [questionable statement]: Introduces a piecewise contribution rule before locking down a reliable complexity path for evaluating it at scale.
- Token 40003 [missed opportunity]: Notices the remaining workload is still around a million heavy terms, but does not convert this into a sharper pruning/grouping strategy.
- Token 47219 [wasted]: Reorders summations again (`d`/`u` swap) without reducing the computational bottleneck.
- Token 54938 [verification]: Implements and tests another prototype (`F_via_d`) on small values, giving real feedback but still not yielding a scalable method.
- Token 60008 [insight]: Recognizes the coprime factor-pair counting subproblem \(C(N)\), a potentially useful abstraction for optimization.
- Token 62808 [missed opportunity]: Correctly identifies the naive \(H_0\) evaluation as too expensive (~\(2\times10^{12}\) operations) but does not pivot to a finalized tractable alternative.
- Token 69983 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly flags that repeated divisor-sum prefix queries may still be too heavy, but continues refining equivalent formulas instead of committing to one executable design.
- Token 73688 [questionable statement]: Relies on memoization-sharing optimism for many divisor-sum queries without demonstrating that the query set collapses enough in practice.
- Token 82186 [mistake]: Abandons the derivation due to time/complexity rather than completing a validated computation route.
- Token 83427 [final answer]: Outputs `\boxed{0}`, which is incorrect versus the known correct value 27534.
