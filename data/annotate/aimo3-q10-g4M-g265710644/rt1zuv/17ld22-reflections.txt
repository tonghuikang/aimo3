## Answer: wrong (64836)

## Key moments
- Token 686 [breakthrough]: Reframes the task as minimizing `lcm(a,b,c)` over divisor triples with fixed sum, which is a productive structural shift from brute-force guessing.
- Token 1354 [mistake]: Assumes the optimal triple can always be taken as `(1,b,c)` and collapses to `f(n)=min lcm(b,c)` with `b+c=n-1`; this excludes better triples and sets up the wrong global formula.
- Token 6046-8903 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch refining casework on “smallest divisor > 2 of `S=n-1`” inside that incorrect model, so substantial work does not improve correctness.
- Token 13765 [breakthrough]: Correctly handles the floor sensitivity for `integer - epsilon` vs `integer + epsilon`, including the `-1` adjustment logic when the base term is integral.
- Token 17936 [verification]: Performs extensive re-checks of gcd/mod arithmetic and floor edge cases, but verification is only internal consistency and does not revisit the foundational `f(n)` assumption.
- Token 23138 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{64836}`, which is incorrect.
