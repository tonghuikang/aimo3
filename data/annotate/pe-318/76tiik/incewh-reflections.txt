## Answer: correct (77726)

## Key moments
- Token 476 [insight]: Identifies the conjugate structure with roots involving \(\sqrt{p}+\sqrt{q}\) and \(\sqrt{q}-\sqrt{p}\), setting up integer-sum reasoning for even powers.
- Token 555-1101 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch in circular recurrence/Galois discussion before landing on a cleaner argument for why \(a^{2n}+b^{2n}\in\mathbb{Z}\).
- Token 1270 [breakthrough]: Writes \(a^{2n}=I_n-b^{2n}\), which makes the fractional-part behavior tractable.
- Token 2780 [questionable statement]: Converts \(q<p+2\sqrt p+1\) into \(q\le p+\lfloor2\sqrt p\rfloor\), which is too restrictive for non-square \(p\).
- Token 4568 [mistake]: Uses the wrong \(q\)-range in the summation setup, dropping admissible pairs.
- Token 4955 [mistake]: Commits to the incorrect intermediate result (modulo \(99991\)) from the undercounted pair set.
- Token 7037 [insight]: Finds a concrete counterexample (e.g., \(p=5,q=10\)) showing \(\sqrt q-\sqrt p<1\) can still hold beyond the earlier bound.
- Token 9122 [breakthrough]: Corrects enumeration logic with the missing \(+1\) for non-square \(p\) and the square-case exclusion at \(d=1\).
- Token 12144 [verification]: Recomputes the total with corrected admissible pairs and high precision, recovering total \(709{,}313{,}889\) and modulo \(77726\).
- Token 16956 [verification]: Cross-checks implementations (float vs high-precision method) across all valid pairs and finds no discrepancies.
- Token 17523 [final answer]: Outputs the final boxed result \(77726\).
