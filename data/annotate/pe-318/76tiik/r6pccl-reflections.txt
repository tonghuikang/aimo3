## Answer: correct (77726)

## Key moments
- Token 124 [insight]: Sets up the conjugate framework with \(a=\sqrt p+\sqrt q\) and \(b=\sqrt q-\sqrt p\), which drives the fractional-part analysis.
- Token 2424 [breakthrough]: Identifies the core criterion \(b<1\) so \(b^{2n}\to0\), giving fractional part \(\to1\).
- Token 3163 [questionable statement]: Rewrites the integer bound as \(q\le p+\lfloor2\sqrt p\rfloor\) too early, without handling the non-square \(+1\) case.
- Token 3698 [mistake]: Treats that floor bound as the exact admissible set, which would exclude valid pairs.
- Token 4042 [insight]: Reopens the inequality using \(L=p+2\sqrt p+1\) and starts a needed integer/non-integer boundary analysis.
- Token 5270 [breakthrough]: Corrects the admissible range to \(q\le\lceil p+2\sqrt p\rceil\), fixing the earlier off-by-one logic.
- Token 6466 [breakthrough]: Converts the digit condition to \(b^{2n}\le10^{-2011}\) and derives the computable ceiling formula for \(N(p,q)\).
- Token 8933 [insight]: Translates the corrected math into a concrete enumeration algorithm over \((p,q)\) with both \(b<1\) and \(p+q\le2011\).
- Token 13018 [verification]: Runs full-pair checks that computed \(N\) values satisfy and minimally meet the threshold inequalities.
- Token 15785-19767 [wasted]: Spends a long asymptotic detour on why \(N\) can become large even after the core computation/verification path is already established.
- Token 20687 [verification]: Recomputes totals with high-precision `mpmath` and confirms the same aggregate \(709{,}313{,}889\).
- Token 22893 [final answer]: Commits to the final value \(\boxed{77726}\).
