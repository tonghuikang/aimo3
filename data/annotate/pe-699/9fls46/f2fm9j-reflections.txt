## Answer: wrong (39775)

## Key moments
- Token 4589 [insight]: The trace notices cross-prime cancellation concretely on `84`, identifying that one prime’s `S(q,a)` can cancel another prime’s denominator factor.
- Token 6743 [breakthrough]: It formalizes the per-prime cancellation inequalities and the special strict condition on leftover 3-adic denominator.
- Token 14590 [missed opportunity]: After deriving a usable condition, it pivots into broad graph speculation instead of immediately locking into a provably complete enumeration design.
- Token 19844 [questionable statement]: It assumes a small-prime bounded recursive search should be enough without a justified completeness argument.
- Token 23972-33884 [wasted]: Large span spent re-framing/rewriting search architecture and factorization machinery repeatedly before converging on a stable correctness model.
- Token 27234 [missed opportunity]: It starts subset-style generation ideas but does not yet enforce a proof that the candidate-prime universe is complete.
- Token 34345 [questionable statement]: The algorithm enforces `a_p <= current_contributions[p]` at insertion time, assuming cancellations must already be available locally.
- Token 39644 [mistake]: The generated set is shown to have both false positives and false negatives at `10^6`, exposing the local-resource insertion rule as incomplete.
- Token 44282 [insight]: It correctly identifies a circular dependency pattern (e.g., primes mutually enabling each other) that cannot be represented by strict one-pass resource consumption.
- Token 44573 [breakthrough]: It switches to the right high-level requirement: validate cancellation inequalities on the full selected exponent vector, not purely incrementally.
- Token 54115-56030 [wasted]: Another long detour into pattern-guessing and candidate-set heuristics before finalizing a robust enumeration/check workflow.
- Token 61599 [questionable statement]: It introduces a core/leaf split that checks core feasibility before leaf inclusion, implicitly assuming leaves cannot rescue core deficits.
- Token 66662 [insight]: It recognizes leaf primes are generated from `S(p,a)` of selected core exponents and should be handled as dependent expansions.
- Token 76348 [breakthrough]: It reforms enumeration around core-exponent choices plus leaf expansion, a faster structure that finally hits the known `10^6` sum.
- Token 79420 [questionable statement]: The implementation still performs core-constraint validation too early (before fully exploring leaf additions).
- Token 84298 [mistake]: Missing known-valid numbers (e.g., with 31/127/19/41) demonstrates premature pruning from early core checks.
- Token 84869 [insight]: It pinpoints the exact bug: core constraints must be checked only after leaf contributions are incorporated.
- Token 85015 [breakthrough]: After moving the constraint check to the final leaf stage, it matches `T(10^6)=26089287`.
- Token 86186 [missed opportunity]: Final validation is limited to small benchmark matches; no independent completeness check is done for the `10^14` search space.
- Token 86224 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{39775}`, which is incorrect.
