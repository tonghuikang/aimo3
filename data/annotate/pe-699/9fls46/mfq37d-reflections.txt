## Answer: correct (68805)

## Key moments
- Token 923 [insight]: The trace simplifies each local factor to `S(p,e)/p^e`, making denominator-vs-support accounting explicit.
- Token 2624 [breakthrough]: It states the global valuation criterion: all `q != 3` must have nonnegative valuation in `A(n)`, while `v_3(A(n))` must stay negative.
- Token 6793 [insight]: It confirms `3` is structurally necessary and that pure powers of `3` form valid base states.
- Token 13881 [insight]: It reframes the task as a constrained search over exponent/support inequalities instead of brute-force over `n`.
- Token 22982 [breakthrough]: It moves to constructive generation from `3^e` using prime-support expansions from factorizations of `S(p,e)`.
- Token 29652 [breakthrough]: It identifies the key nontrivial branch mechanism (e.g., Mersenne-style supports like `S(2,6)=127`) that enables larger 2-adic exponents.
- Token 37052 [breakthrough]: It implements the cached state-space generator (`exponents + S-factor supports`) for full enumeration under the bound.
- Token 38918 [questionable statement]: It assumes the initial state enumeration/summing logic is already correct before strict dedup-and-qualification accounting.
- Token 39898 [mistake]: Benchmark comparison reveals incorrect totals from counting logic in early implementation.
- Token 40560 [breakthrough]: It fixes dedup/result-set handling and restores correct benchmark behavior.
- Token 41879 [verification]: It reproduces `T(10^6)=26089287`, matching the provided check.
- Token 42451 [verification]: It computes exact-set sum and modulus for the `10^14` run to validate the reported modulo path.
- Token 42591 [verification]: It rechecks `T(100)=270` with the same generator as a second anchor.
- Token 42683 [final answer]: Commits `\boxed{68805}`, which is correct.
