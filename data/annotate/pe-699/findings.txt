Problem: Find T(10^14) mod 99991, where T(N) is the sum of all n <= N such that sigma(n)/n in lowest terms has denominator 3^k with k > 0.

Correct answer: 68805

Correct approach:
- Write n = prod p^{e_p} and A(n)=sigma(n)/n = prod S(p,e_p)/p^{e_p}, where S(p,e)=1+p+...+p^e.
- For each prime q != 3 dividing n, cancellation condition is:
  e_q <= sum_{p != q} v_q(S(p,e_p)).
  This means every non-3 denominator exponent must be fully covered by numerator factors from other prime blocks.
- For q=3, strict leftover denominator is required:
  sum_{p != 3} v_3(S(p,e_p)) < e_3.
- Enumerate states by DFS from base powers of 3, cache factorizations of S(p,e), and expand via primes that appear in support factorizations.
- Accept states satisfying the inequalities above and sum all n <= 10^14.
- This enumeration gives 2979 valid numbers and exact sum 37010438774467572, so modulo 99991 is 68805. It also reproduces T(100)=270 and T(10^6)=26089287.

Wrong approach 1 (k3v7ko, output 0):
- Uses incomplete sequential-support generation that misses mutually supporting prime cycles (valid numbers requiring nonlocal/cyclic support).
- Later optimization also applies sigma(ab)=sigma(a)sigma(b) in non-coprime multiplication contexts, which is invalid and corrupts filtering.
- Fails to complete a correct full enumeration and ends with placeholder 0.

Wrong approach 2 (f2fm9j, output 39775):
- Uses a core/leaf decomposition with premature feasibility checks (core constraints enforced before leaf-generated support is fully incorporated).
- This pruning misses valid constructions and yields an incomplete candidate set at large N, despite matching small checks.
- Produces exact sum 24819041643939492 and modulo 39775, which is incorrect.
