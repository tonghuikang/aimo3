## Answer: correct (5226432553)

## Key moments
- Token 305 [insight]: Frames the outer sum as a binomial transform, setting up generating-function machinery.
- Token 2327 [questionable statement]: Treats a leading-digits-via-logarithms route as the primary path before exploiting exact algebraic structure.
- Token 2749 [mistake]: Commits to the high-precision log/fractional-part plan, which is unnecessary for this exact-combinatorial problem.
- Token 7898-9115 [wasted]: Lengthy diagonal/integral setup does not yield a practical formula for \(g(m)\).
- Token 13902 [insight]: Introduces an alternating-binomial closed-sum identity after reindexing the double sum.
- Token 14070 [breakthrough]: Collapses the inner alternating sum to a single binomial term and isolates the effective index range.
- Token 19165-21218 [wasted]: Extended contour/saddle analysis continues after a simpler coefficient-based route is already available.
- Token 25564 [breakthrough]: Recognizes only degree-\(\le 5\) terms matter in the \(w\)-expansion, implying exact \(g(m)=7^m h(m)\) with degree-5 polynomial \(h\).
- Token 29700 [verification]: Interpolates \(h(m)\) from computed values and checks the explicit polynomial form.
- Token 31535 [verification]: Numerically verifies \(g(10)=7^{10}h(10)\), confirming decomposition correctness.
- Token 32042 [verification]: Cross-checks the closed form against direct computation on multiple \(m\) values.
- Token 32438 [final answer]: Commits to the leading ten base-7 digits \(5226432553\) (with later formatting clarification to plain integer form).
