## Answer: correct (5226432553)

## Key moments
- Token 630 [verification]: Computes small exact values of \(g(m)\) to ground later symbolic work.
- Token 6163-8430 [wasted]: Long hypergeometric/Pochhammer manipulation does not produce a usable closed form.
- Token 12983 [insight]: Identifies \(\sum_{i=0}^j (-1)^{j-i}\binom{j}{i}X^i=(X-1)^j\), the key simplification for the alternating inner sum.
- Token 13310 [breakthrough]: Collapses the inner sum into a coefficient-extraction form based on \(((1+u)^6-1)^j\), exposing exploitable structure.
- Token 14964 [questionable statement]: Suggests \(S_j\) may be a degree-5 polynomial in \(j\), overlooking exponential \(6^j\) scaling.
- Token 15037 [mistake]: Treats that polynomial-growth idea as viable before reconciling it with observed magnitude.
- Token 15146 [breakthrough]: Corrects the growth model by restoring the \(6^{j-k}\) contributions, giving \(S_j=6^j\cdot\text{poly}(j)\).
- Token 15900 [breakthrough]: Uses binomial-transform identities to obtain \(g(m)=7^m Q(m)\) with \(Q\) degree 5.
- Token 17025 [verification]: Confirms constant fifth finite difference of \(g(m)/7^m\), validating the degree-5 polynomial claim.
- Token 18064 [verification]: Interpolates explicit \(Q(m)\) and checks consistency against computed values.
- Token 18862 [verification]: Converts \(Q(142857)\) to base 7 and reads the leading digits.
- Token 19138 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{5226432553}\).
