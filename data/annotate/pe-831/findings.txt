## Correct answer
The first ten digits of \(g(142857)\) in base 7 are:

**5226432553**

## Correct approach
1. Collapse the inner alternating binomial sum with
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{j}(-1)^{j-i}\binom{j}{i}X^i=(X-1)^j.
\]
This gives a coefficient form where low-degree terms control the result.
2. Show the structure
\[
g(m)=7^m\,h(m),
\]
with \(h(m)\) a degree-5 polynomial in \(m\).
3. Compute
\[
h(m)=\frac{81m^5+765m^4+2085m^3+1835m^2+474m+40}{40}.
\]
4. Evaluate \(h(142857)\), convert that integer to base 7, and take its first ten digits.  
Since multiplying by \(7^m\) only appends trailing zeros in base 7, the leading digits of \(g(m)\) are exactly the leading digits of \(h(m)\).

## Wrong approaches and why they fail
- Using only asymptotic/log-leading-digit estimation: can miss required exact leading digits; this problem admits an exact polynomial reduction.
- Spending effort on heavy contour/diagonal/hypergeometric machinery without finishing the reduction: high risk of algebra drift, no practical gain over the direct coefficient method.
- Outputting the decimal value of the base-7 digit string (or adding unrelated modulo processing): the task asks for the first ten base-7 digits themselves, i.e. `5226432553`.
