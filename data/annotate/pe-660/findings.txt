## Problem: pe-660 - n-pandigital triangles

### Problem Statement
Find integer-sided triangles with a 120° angle where, in base n, the three sides use all n digits (0 to n-1) exactly once. Sum the largest sides across all such triangles for n = 9 to 18, modulo 99991.

### Correct Answer: 9515

### Key Mathematical Insights

1. **Law of Cosines for 120° angle**: For a triangle with angle 120° between sides a and b, the opposite side c satisfies:
   c² = a² + b² + ab

2. **c is the largest side**: Since 120° > 90°, the side opposite this angle is always the largest.

3. **Eisenstein triples**: Integer solutions to c² = a² + b² + ab can be parameterized using:
   - a = m² - n²
   - b = 2mn + n²
   - c = m² + mn + n²
   (for integers m > n ≥ 1 with same parity, up to scaling)

4. **Pandigital condition**: In base n, the three sides collectively must use each digit 0 through n-1 exactly once. This means:
   - Total number of digits across all three numbers = n
   - No digit repeats
   - No leading zeros (all sides are positive integers)

### Correct Approach
1. Generate primitive Eisenstein triples using the parameterization
2. For each primitive triple, test scaling factors k to find (ka, kb, kc)
3. For each candidate triple, check if the base-n representation uses each digit exactly once
4. Sum the largest sides (c values) across all found triangles for n = 9 to 18

### Why This Works
- The parameterization captures all integer solutions to the Eisenstein equation
- The pandigital condition is very restrictive, so few triples qualify
- The sum of largest sides = 474,766,783
- 474,766,783 mod 99991 = 9515

### Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to consider scaled triples (not just primitive)
- Missing solutions due to insufficient bounds on parameters m, n, or k
- Incorrect handling of digit uniqueness check
