## Answer: correct (39756)

## Key moments
- Token 816 [insight]: Realizes Gaussian squarefreeness is not equivalent to integer norm squarefreeness, so the counting must be done with Gaussian-prime structure.
- Token 5605 [questionable statement]: Writes the split-prime density factor with only one `(1-1/p^2)` term for `p ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, which undercounts split contributions.
- Token 6357 [mistake]: Treats the resulting product mismatch (`~0.700989` vs expected `1/ζ_{Q(i)}(2)`) as a formula inconsistency instead of a split-prime multiplicity error.
- Token 7145 [insight]: Checks `p=5` examples and notices there are two proper split primes (`1+2i` and `2+i`) at the same norm.
- Token 7646 [breakthrough]: Corrects the Euler product to include squared split-prime factors and reconciles with `1/ζ_{Q(i)}(2)`.
- Token 15723 [missed opportunity]: Notes direct computation up to `10^7` should be feasible, but continues long theoretical detours before coding the final path.
- Token 23547 [insight]: Recognizes `B[n]` is sparse (norm-representability constraints), which supports a practical summation strategy.
- Token 26013-27576 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch over-engineering linear-sieve update machinery before validating a stable recurrence.
- Token 26708 [questionable statement]: Assumes `B[n]` can be safely propagated from `B[i]` via local ratios even when intermediate local factors are zero.
- Token 34057 [mistake]: Finds the sieve recurrence fails on cases like `n=9` (`p≡3 mod 4`), where zero-propagation incorrectly kills valid `e=2` contributions.
- Token 34912 [insight]: Reframes `B[n]` as a pure product over rational-prime exponents, independent of intermediate zero states.
- Token 35258 [breakthrough]: Switches to SPF-based exponent extraction (`B[n]=B[n/p^e]*factor(p,e)`), fixing the recurrence logic.
- Token 37583 [questionable statement]: Stores `B[n]` modulo `99991` inside the multiplicative buildup, risking sign/cancellation corruption.
- Token 38247 [mistake]: Gets the wrong checkpoint value (`f(10^8) mod 99991 = 31595`), confirming the modularized `B` pipeline is invalid.
- Token 40945 [insight]: Identifies that `B` must stay exact signed integers; modulo should be applied only at the outer sum.
- Token 41824 [breakthrough]: Recomputes with exact `B` values and restores agreement with known cases.
- Token 43442 [verification]: Verifies against provided references (`f(10^2)=54`, `f(10^4)=5218`, and `f(10^8)` modulo `99991`).
- Token 43511 [verification]: Runs the target case `N=10^14` and gets `39756`.
- Token 45411 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{39756}`.
