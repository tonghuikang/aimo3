## Answer: correct (79026)

## Key moments
- Token 175 [insight]: Frames the task as indexing numbers that avoid forbidden decimal substrings, requiring counting + inverse ranking rather than direct search.
- Token 401 [breakthrough]: Commits to DFA/Aho-Corasick modeling with length-wise counting and lexicographic digit construction, which is the correct global strategy.
- Token 636-1913 [wasted]: Extended heuristic density/recurrence discussion is exploratory but not used in the final exact computation pipeline.
- Token 2291 [breakthrough]: Starts the concrete implementation plan for automaton states, bad-state marking, and DP transitions.
- Token 5448 [breakthrough]: Implements `compute_counts` to get exact counts by length and cumulative totals for locating the target block.
- Token 6366 [insight]: Derives that \(E(10^{18})\) lies among 19-digit numbers and computes the within-length rank \(158{,}445{,}117{,}918{,}141{,}003\).
- Token 6940 [breakthrough]: Implements `find_nth` digit-by-digit construction using DP suffix counts, yielding the exact target integer and modulo.
- Token 7809 [verification]: Checks known examples \(E(3)\), \(E(200)\), and \(E(500000)\), validating ranking/index logic.
- Token 8406 [verification]: Performs additional brute-force/random consistency checks on smaller ranges to validate implementation behavior.
- Token 9789-10189 [wasted]: Long semantic digression on leading-zero substring interpretation does not change transitions or the computed result.
- Token 11582 [final answer]: Finalizes `\boxed{79026}` (correct).
