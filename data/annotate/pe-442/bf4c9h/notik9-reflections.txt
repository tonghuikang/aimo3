## Answer: correct (79026)

## Key moments
- Token 189 [insight]: Identifies this as a large-index forbidden-substring counting problem and proposes automaton + counting instead of direct enumeration.
- Token 742 [breakthrough]: Commits to Aho-Corasick + DP over lengths, which is the core scalable method for this problem.
- Token 1694-2594 [wasted]: Long probabilistic density estimation of `"11"` occurrences does not affect the exact construction algorithm or any later numeric step.
- Token 2845 [breakthrough]: Implements the automaton construction, enabling exact transition-state counting for forbidden substrings.
- Token 4057 [breakthrough]: Implements `compute_counts` DP and obtains exact per-length counts needed to locate the target length.
- Token 4691 [insight]: Uses cumulative counts to place \(E(10^{18})\) in 19-digit numbers and compute the in-length rank.
- Token 4967 [breakthrough]: Implements digit-by-digit `kth_string_of_length` selection from DP suffix counts, producing the exact target integer.
- Token 5628 [verification]: Brute-force checks small-length counts against DP, validating automaton transitions and counting logic.
- Token 6005 [verification]: Verifies known samples \(E(3)=3\), \(E(200)=213\), \(E(500000)=531563\), confirming rank/index correctness.
- Token 6217-6260 [wasted]: Repeats modulo confirmation after correctness is already established by prior checks.
- Token 6358 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{79026}` (correct).
