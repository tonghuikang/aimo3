# PE 517 Findings

## Correct answer
`581468882`

## Correct approach
- For fixed `a`, `g_a(x)` is the count of subtraction sequences with steps `{1, a}` that stop at the first time the remainder is `< a`.
- Equivalent threshold view: prefix step-sums stay `<= x-a`, and the final step crosses `x-a`.
- This yields:
`G(n) = 1 + Σ_{i=1}^{⌊√n⌋} C( n - ⌊i√n⌋ + i - 1, i )`.
- For each prime `p` in `(10,000,000, 10,010,000)`, compute the above sum mod `1,000,000,007`, then sum over primes.
- Efficient implementation uses factorial / inverse-factorial modulo `1,000,000,007` (up to about `10,010,000`) and a sieve for primes in the interval.

## Wrong approaches and failure modes
- Wrong model: “exact composition of integer `n` by `1` and irrational `√n`”.
This implies only zero `√n`-steps are possible, incorrectly predicting `G(n)=1` for non-squares, contradicting `G(90)=7564511`.
- Wrong proxy: replace `a=√n` by integer `a=⌈√n⌉` (or `⌊√n⌋`) everywhere and use integer-step recurrence formula.
It only matches near the top of a square interval, but fails generally; e.g. `n=27` gives `414` (with `a=6`) or `1001` (with `a=5`) instead of `756`.
- Wrong analytic continuation: using generalized real-binomial sums directly (gamma-based extension of integer formula) overcounts; e.g. for `n=90` it gives about `8,060,291` instead of `7,564,511`.
