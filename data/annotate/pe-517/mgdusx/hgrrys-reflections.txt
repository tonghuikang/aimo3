## Answer: correct (581468882)

## Key moments
- Token 259 [questionable statement]: It starts with an exact-composition interpretation that treats irrational-step behavior too much like the integer-step case.
- Token 483 [mistake]: It infers that non-square `n` should force `G(n)=1`, which directly conflicts with the provided `G(90)=7564511`.
- Token 4148 [insight]: It identifies the correct “first crossing of `n-a`” viewpoint: prefixes stay under the threshold and the last step crosses it.
- Token 12081 [missed opportunity]: It diverts into sampling/pattern exploration (piecewise behavior experiments) instead of immediately formalizing the threshold-crossing count.
- Token 17575-23972 [wasted]: Long speculative exploration of guessed recurrences, generating-function ideas, and ballot analogies does not yet yield a computable formula.
- Token 26337 [insight]: It writes an explicit decomposition into final-step-`1` and final-step-`a` combinatorial sums.
- Token 31949 [questionable statement]: It treats the first closed-form implementation as essentially settled before resolving interval-bound edge cases.
- Token 34186 [mistake]: The formula fails against `G(90)`, exposing an off-by-one/interval-cardinality error in the counting bounds.
- Token 37526 [insight]: It correctly focuses debugging on strict/open interval boundaries and floor/ceil boundary handling.
- Token 44713 [insight]: It derives the right integer-count rule for `(L-a, L]` (count can be `m` or `m+1` depending on fractional parts), fixing the overcount source.
- Token 47629 [breakthrough]: Corrected terms telescope to a compact usable formula and match checked values, unlocking the efficient prime-interval computation.
- Token 51887 [verification]: It verifies the corrected formula against brute recursion over many small non-square inputs.
- Token 53312 [verification]: It verifies the prime-specialized fast form on small primes before scaling to the target interval.
- Token 58349 [final answer]: It commits to the final value `581468882`.
