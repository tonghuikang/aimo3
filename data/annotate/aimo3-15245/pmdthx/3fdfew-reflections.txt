## Answer: wrong (58292)

## Key moments
- Token 575 [breakthrough]: Sets up the {1,d,M} divisor triple and derives M = 6p - 1 - d as the minimization framework.
- Token 887 [breakthrough]: Deduces d | (6p - 1), turning the search into a divisor/factorization problem.
- Token 1206 [breakthrough]: Notes that the minimal M in this framework comes from the largest proper divisor (smallest prime factor of 6p-1).
- Token 2733 [wasted]: Spends time checking M = 3p and enumerating its divisors, which cannot reach sum 6p.
- Token 4783 [breakthrough]: Recognizes the multiple-of-p construction {p,2p,3p} giving M = 6p via LCM.
- Token 6908-7187 [wasted]: Long upper-bound analysis using M/2, M/3, etc. without sharpening the candidate set.
- Token 9607 [breakthrough]: Concludes the smallest “all multiples of p” solution is M = 6p.
- Token 12435 [breakthrough]: Factors 6p+1 and computes M_self = (48*3^30+8)/5 from the a=5 case.
- Token 13381 [verification]: Checks divisor consistency for M_self and confirms the arithmetic.
- Token 15165 [missed opportunity]: Acknowledges the need to compare with proper-divisor-only cases but does not exploit p-1’s smooth factorization.
- Token 17101 [wasted]: Speculates about M in (4p,6p) without deriving a constructive bound.
- Token 19052 [wasted]: Explores ad-hoc divisor choices (like 2p+1) without a usable criterion.
- Token 20218 [breakthrough]: States the general LCM-minimization perspective for divisors a,b,c.
- Token 22031 [wasted]: Tests g=2 case with large LCMs, not improving the candidate.
- Token 24002 [wasted]: Uses a coarse lower bound on LCM(x,y,z) for g=6 but no constructive improvement.
- Token 26405 [wasted]: Checks g=3 with x=1,y=2,z=2p-3, yielding an overly large LCM.
- Token 27055 [mistake]: Dismisses d=6 using only (1,2,p-3), missing the b | (p-1) choice that gives N=8*3^30.
- Token 28182 [verification]: Computes the modular inverse of 5 and finishes the mod arithmetic.
- Token 28385 [final answer]: Outputs 58292 as the final remainder (incorrect).
