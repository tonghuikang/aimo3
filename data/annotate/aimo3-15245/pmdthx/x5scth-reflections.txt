## Answer: correct (15245)

## Key moments
- Token 2540 [breakthrough]: Reframes the task as minimizing LCM(a,b,c) over triples summing to 6p.
- Token 3013 [breakthrough]: Analyzes the “one divides the other” chain case to minimize the largest divisor.
- Token 5101 [breakthrough]: Eliminates d=2p,3p,6p cases for common-factor scaling, narrowing viable d.
- Token 6029 [wasted]: Generic discussion of whether LCM<6p is possible without concrete progress.
- Token 8023 [wasted]: Works through the d=3 case algebra for y and N but yields a large candidate.
- Token 9148 [breakthrough]: Chooses y=(2p-1)/109 and computes k=108 in the d=3 scenario.
- Token 11026 [breakthrough]: Restates the optimization as finding the smallest c with two proper divisors summing to S-c.
- Token 12196 [breakthrough]: Factors 3p-1 and sets up the d=2 divisor-maximization logic.
- Token 14010 [breakthrough]: In the d=6 case, observes b | (p-1)=2·3^30 and identifies b_max=(p-1)/3.
- Token 16033 [breakthrough]: Argues that the largest divisor below half gives minimal c, leading toward N=8·3^30.
- Token 18047 [breakthrough]: Formalizes the “minimize z with two divisors summing to S−z” criterion.
- Token 20000 [wasted]: Computes the d=3 candidate N to confirm it is larger than the d=6 construction.
- Token 21393 [verification]: Prepares the modulo computation for N=8·3^30.
- Token 21403 [final answer]: Computes N mod 99991 = 15245 and locks in the result.
