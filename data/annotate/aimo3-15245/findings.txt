# Problem: aimo3-15245

## Problem Statement
p = 2 * 3^30 + 1 is prime. A positive integer is called Norwegian if it has three distinct positive divisors whose sum is equal to 6p. Let N be the smallest Norwegian positive integer. What is the remainder when N is divided by 99991?

## Correct Answer
15245

## Key Values
- p = 2 * 3^30 + 1 = 411,782,264,189,299
- 6p = 2,470,693,585,135,794
- N = 8 * 3^30 = 1,647,129,056,757,192
- N mod 99991 = 15245

## Correct Approach

The problem reduces to minimizing LCM(a,b,c) where a+b+c = 6p with a,b,c distinct positive integers.

### Key technique: Use common factor d
If a = d*x, b = d*y, c = d*z where d divides 6p, then:
- Sum = d*(x+y+z) = 6p, so x+y+z = 6p/d := S
- LCM(a,b,c) = d*LCM(x,y,z)
- N = d*LCM(x,y,z)

### Minimizing LCM(x,y,z) given sum S
For minimal LCM, use x=1, then y+z = S-1. If y divides z, then LCM(1,y,z) = z.
So we need: y | z, y+z = S-1, and z is minimized.

This means: y | (S-1-y), so y | (S-1).
Thus y is a divisor of S-1. To minimize z = S-1-y, we maximize y.
The largest y < (S-1)/2 that divides S-1 is (S-1)/t where t is the smallest divisor of S-1 greater than 2.

### Case d = 6
- S = p = 2*3^30 + 1
- S - 1 = p - 1 = 2*3^30
- Smallest divisor of 2*3^30 greater than 2 is t = 3
- y = (p-1)/3 = 2*3^29
- z = (p-1) - y = (p-1) * (t-1)/t = (2*3^30) * (2/3) = 4*3^29
- LCM(1,y,z) = z = 4*3^29
- N = d * z = 6 * 4*3^29 = 24*3^29 = 8*3^30

**N = 8 * 3^30 ≈ 1.647e15**

### Verification
The three divisors of N are:
- a = 6*1 = 6
- b = 6 * 2*3^29 = 12*3^29
- c = 6 * 4*3^29 = 24*3^29 = N

Sum = 6 + 12*3^29 + 24*3^29 = 6 + 36*3^29 = 6 + 12*3^30 = 6(1 + 2*3^30) = 6p ✓

N mod 99991 = 15245 ✓

## Wrong Approaches

### Wrong Answer: 58292 (trace 3fdfew)
This trace uses a different construction: divisors {1, d, M} where M = 6p - 1 - d and d divides 6p-1.
It factors S = 6p-1 = 12*3^30 + 5, finds that 5 divides S.
Then constructs M = (S-1)*(5-1)/5 = (48*3^30 + 8)/5 ≈ 9.65*3^30 ≈ 1.987e15.

This approach is valid but produces a LARGER N than the d=6 approach!
The error is that the trace doesn't properly compare this with the d=6 case that yields N = 8*3^30 ≈ 1.647e15.

M = (48*3^30 + 8)/5 ≈ 1.987e15 > 8*3^30 ≈ 1.647e15

So the {1, d, M} approach with M as one of the divisors gives a larger N than the {d*1, d*y, d*z} approach with common factor d=6.

### Wrong Answer: 87432 (trace zrfqy9)
This trace uses yet another construction method and arrives at N = 2,964,832,302,162,942 which is also larger than 8*3^30.

## Critical Decision Points

1. **Recognizing that N = LCM(a,b,c)**: The smallest Norwegian integer is the LCM of the three divisors.

2. **Using common factor d**: The key insight is to factor out d from all three divisors, reducing the problem to finding x+y+z = S with minimal LCM(x,y,z).

3. **Choosing d = 6**: This gives S = p, and crucially p-1 = 2*3^30 which has t=3 as its smallest divisor > 2, leading to a very efficient solution.

4. **Comparing approaches**: The {1, d, M} approach (where M is itself a divisor) vs the common factor approach. The common factor approach with d=6 gives smaller N.
