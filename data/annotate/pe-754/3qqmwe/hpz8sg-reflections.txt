## Answer: wrong (331358692)

## Key moments
- Token 278 [insight]: Sets up `G(N)=∏_{j=1}^N j^{e_j}` with `e_j=#{i∈[j,N]:(i,j)=1}`, which is the right counting perspective.
- Token 1187 [breakthrough]: Derives `e_j=(⌊N/j⌋-1)φ(j)+r(N,j)` and cleanly separates full-block and remainder contributions.
- Token 4686 [insight]: Rewrites the remainder term through Möbius/divisor sums, moving toward multiplicative interval aggregation.
- Token 6388 [breakthrough]: Identifies block-level quantities `S(t)=Σ μ(d)` and `P(t)=∏ d^{μ(d)}` over quotient intervals, a viable computational route.
- Token 15003 [missed opportunity]: Leaves the workable block plan and shifts into speculative Dirichlet-series exploration.
- Token 15003-32614 [wasted]: Extended detour across alternative transforms (`Q/H/R` recurrences, prime-series identities) without producing an executable end-to-end method.
- Token 24297 [insight]: Finds a compact prime-contribution relation candidate (`c(p)` via Mertens values), which could have served as a focused validation branch.
- Token 34180 [questionable statement]: Assumes factorial-part aggregation yields a simple closed exponent law for each base `j`.
- Token 36358 [mistake]: Commits to `exp_j = μ(j)*(N//j)^2 + Σ_{d≤N/j} μ(d)*(N//d)`, an over-simplified expression that does not hold generally.
- Token 41996-56047 [wasted]: Spends another long span designing offline prime-event machinery (`Q(x), H(x), K(t)`) instead of executing the earlier interval method.
- Token 44269 [questionable statement]: Swaps weighted valuation sums into a denominator-exponent form without preserving all dependency constraints.
- Token 45966 [mistake]: Uses `exponent_p = M*(N+1) - (M(M+1)/2)*(p+1)`, which is inconsistent with later small-case checks.
- Token 48616 [missed opportunity]: Detects the exponent derivation is flawed but does not return to the earlier valid block decomposition pipeline.
- Token 56047 [missed opportunity]: Starts a `compute_R(x)` recursion direction but never connects it to a completed computation.
- Token 62014 [questionable statement]: Introduces another substitution (`M' = floor((N//p)/d')`) as if dependencies were separable.
- Token 63589 [mistake]: Concludes from unresolved algebra that brute-force style evaluation is likely intended, despite earlier evidence for interval optimization.
- Token 73399-80706 [wasted]: Continues oscillating between “Python sieve too slow” and new recursion ideas, still without completing a runnable solution path.
- Token 80706 [questionable statement]: Considers outputting a placeholder despite lacking a validated derivation.
- Token 84258 [mistake]: Abandons solving and switches to guessing, breaking the reasoning-to-answer chain.
- Token 84452 [final answer]: Outputs `\boxed{331358692}` (the `G(10)` modulus), which is not the required value for `G(10^8)`.
