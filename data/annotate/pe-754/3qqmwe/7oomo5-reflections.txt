## Answer: correct (785845900)

## Key moments
- Token 161 [insight]: Rewrites the nested product as `G(N)=∏_{j=1}^N j^{c_j}`, where `c_j` counts how many `i∈[j,N]` are coprime to `j`.
- Token 2540 [breakthrough]: Expresses `c_j` as `f(N,j)-φ(j)+δ_{j=1}`, giving an exact decomposition into total coprime counts minus the prefix below `j`.
- Token 8957 [insight]: Uses Möbius inversion for coprime counting (`Σ_{d|j} μ(d)⌊m/d⌋`), enabling divisor-sum rewrites of exponents.
- Token 15103 [questionable statement]: Starts extrapolating product structure for `g(n)` from small prime-power experiments, which is not a reliable general derivation.
- Token 15611 [mistake]: Conjectures a simplified exponent pattern like `N-⌊N/k⌋`; this drops the divisor-conditioned Möbius terms and is not valid.
- Token 16139 [breakthrough]: Corrects course with `E(k)=Σ_{d|k} μ(d)(⌊N/d⌋-k/d)` (plus `k=1` handling), restoring a sound formula.
- Token 20220 [breakthrough]: Reorganizes into a Möbius-weighted outer product with `q=⌊N/d⌋`, separating the computation into interval-dependent `μ` aggregates and a `q`-dependent factorial-type term.
- Token 22013 [insight]: Identifies that only `O(√N)` quotient endpoints are needed, so prefix sums/products only need to be queried at block boundaries.
- Token 23330-25231 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch exploring alternate hyperfactorial/factorial evaluation paths before converging on a simpler single-pass recording method.
- Token 25791 [breakthrough]: Introduces `prodPlus/prodMinus` and `M_prod[q]=prodPlus·inv(prodMinus)` to compute interval `∏ d^{μ(d)}` efficiently.
- Token 29368 [missed opportunity]: Has a complete algorithmic structure but delays execution with extra feasibility debate instead of implementing immediately.
- Token 32048 [breakthrough]: Commits to a concrete C++ implementation plan with linear sieve + block aggregation and starts coding.
- Token 36560 [insight]: Simplifies memory/performance choices (avoids oversized index arrays and keeps per-block aggregates compact), making full-scale run practical.
- Token 42965 [verification]: Validates compiled C++ output against brute-force Python for small `N` (up to at least `20`) and matches exactly.
- Token 43673 [verification]: Runs performance-scaled checks (`10^6`, `10^7`) and then executes the target `N=10^8` computation.
- Token 43807 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{785845900}`.
