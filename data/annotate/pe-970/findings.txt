## Problem Summary
A kangaroo hops along the real line in the positive direction, with each hop uniformly distributed on (0,1). H(n) is the expected number of hops to exceed n. Find the first 8 decimal digits after the decimal point that differ from 6 for H(10^6), modulo 99991.

## Correct Answer
58052

## Correct Approach
1. Model as a renewal process with `N(t)=max{k: S_k<=t}` and `m(t)=E[N(t)]`.
2. Convert target: `H(n)=m(n)+1`.
3. For `X~Unif(0,1)`, renewal equation gives:
   - `m(t)=e^t-1` for `0<=t<=1`
   - `m'(t)=m(t)-m(t-1)` for `t>1`
4. Characteristic equation `lambda + e^{-lambda} - 1 = 0` has a double root at `0` and all other roots with negative real part, so:
   - linear main term + exponentially tiny oscillatory correction
   - `H(n)=2n+2/3+epsilon_n`, with `|epsilon_n|` decaying like `e^{-2.0888n}`.
5. At `n=10^6`, `epsilon_n` is about `10^-907174` and negative, so the fractional part is `2/3-|epsilon_n|`.
6. Converting this to decimal digits yields first 8 non-6 digits `44754029`; modulo `99991` gives `58052`.

## Wrong Approaches and Why They Fail
- Using the wrong renewal-function normalization (mixing definitions that include/exclude the initial renewal) leads to a wrong offset like `2n+5/3`; this contradicts sample-scale behavior and the correct shift.
- Assuming only the sign of `epsilon_n` is needed is insufficient; the mantissa digits matter for the first eight non-6 digits.
- Doing digit subtraction from repeating 6s without carry/borrow handling gives wrong local digits once mantissa digits above 6 appear.
- Trying direct high-precision integration up to `n=10^6` is impractical for this target; asymptotic + root-based extraction is the viable route.
