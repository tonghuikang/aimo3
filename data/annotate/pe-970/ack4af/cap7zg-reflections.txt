## Answer: correct (58052)

## Key moments
- Token 91 [insight]: Frames the problem as a renewal/hitting-time process and sets up the `H(n)` vs counting-function relationship.
- Token 1076 [breakthrough]: Derives the core equation `m(t)=1+\int_{t-1}^{t}m(u)\,du` (and corresponding DDE), enabling asymptotic analysis.
- Token 1362 [questionable statement]: Applies the renewal constant as if the counting-function shift were already resolved, steering toward `H≈2n+5/3`.
- Token 2212 [mistake]: Treats the `5/3` offset as plausible for large `n`, conflicting with the provided small-`n` behavior.
- Token 4303 [insight]: Reopens definition bookkeeping (`U` vs arrivals-after-time-0) to fix the constant-offset confusion.
- Token 5529 [breakthrough]: Corrects the asymptotic normalization to `m(t)=2t-1/3`, hence `H(t)=2t+2/3`.
- Token 6525 [verification]: Validates digit-extraction semantics from examples: only digit `6` is skipped; `0` and others are kept.
- Token 7041 [missed opportunity]: Spends substantial effort on sign-pattern speculation before directly evaluating the correction term.
- Token 8272 [insight]: Numerically identifies nonzero complex roots of `λ+e^{-λ}-1=0`, establishing the decay structure.
- Token 8570 [breakthrough]: Recognizes dominant root real part `≈ -2.0888`, implying deviation appears around ~907k decimal places.
- Token 11334 [questionable statement]: Uses a heuristic about “enough non-6 digits” to argue sign, before a direct computation.
- Token 17178 [verification]: Runs moderate-`n` numerical checks and correctly notes coarse ODE stepping is not reliable for final sign inference.
- Token 22138 [insight]: Derives Laplace form `M(s)=(1-e^{-s})/[s(s-1+e^{-s})]`.
- Token 23295 [breakthrough]: Gets expansion `H(t)=2t+2/3+\sum C_j e^{λ_j t}` to isolate exponentially small correction terms.
- Token 25557 [verification]: Confirms residue simplification at nonzero poles (`C_j=1/λ_j`), tightening the correction formula.
- Token 30191 [wasted]: Long detour about infeasible raw precision requirements before returning to mantissa/exponent reasoning.
- Token 34075 [insight]: Computes leading correction directly in scientific form via dominant root evaluation.
- Token 34502 [breakthrough]: Pins the key value `ε≈-2.019126…×10^-907174`, making digit extraction concrete.
- Token 35959 [questionable statement]: Initially maps result digits as `6-d_i` from mantissa digits without fully handling borrow cascades.
- Token 36744 [mistake]: Detects that digits like `9` force borrow propagation, invalidating the naive digit-by-digit subtraction.
- Token 39228-44944 [wasted]: Extended algebraic reformulations of scaled subtraction before converging on a simpler construction.
- Token 45825 [insight]: Defines `r0` and `f_sub=2/3-r0`, cleanly separating position-`p` and post-`p` digit behavior.
- Token 47506 [breakthrough]: Extracts the first eight non-6 digits as `44754029`.
- Token 48491 [verification]: Checks that omitted roots are far too small to alter the leading extracted digits.
- Token 52280 [verification]: Re-checks mantissa/sign stability and confirms the digit sequence is unchanged.
- Token 52754 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{58052}`.
