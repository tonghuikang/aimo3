## Answer: correct (819963842)

## Key moments
- Token 131 [insight]: Frames the problem as counting disjoint-digit pairs and subtracting them from total pairs on `[1, n-1]`.
- Token 591 [breakthrough]: Switches to exact digit-mask counts `c[mask]` and uses the ordered disjoint sum with a divide-by-2 step for unordered pairs.
- Token 1486 [questionable statement]: Oscillates between multiple equivalent counting routes (direct mask DP vs subset/Mobius variants), adding complexity before settling on one implementation.
- Token 3730 [verification]: The DP pipeline reproduces `f(100)=1539`, matching the given check value.
- Token 4395 [verification]: First full large-case computation reports `819963842`, consistent with the intended target quantity.
- Token 5604 [missed opportunity]: After already matching the sample and target computation, the trace could have finalized instead of continuing with extra detours.
- Token 5662-6272 [wasted]: Extended side exploration (alternate derivation attempts plus modulus factorization) does not change the method or final value.
- Token 6465 [verification]: Reconfirms the `inv2` handling for halving ordered-pair counts under an odd modulus.
- Token 6508 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{819963842}`; this final answer is correct.
