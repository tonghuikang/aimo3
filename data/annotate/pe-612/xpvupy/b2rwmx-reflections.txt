## Answer: correct (819963842)

## Key moments
- Token 48 [insight]: Reframes the task as total pairs minus disjoint-digit pairs on `[1, n-1]`, which sets up the complement-count strategy.
- Token 173 [breakthrough]: Commits to counting numbers by exact digit masks and explicitly handles the leading-zero rule (digit `0` only enters the mask after the number has started).
- Token 947 [questionable statement]: Briefly drifts into primality/Fermat-style inverse thinking, even though only invertibility of `2` modulo an odd modulus is needed.
- Token 4609 [verification]: Brute-force check for `N=99` returns `1539`, matching the problem’s provided example.
- Token 5038 [verification]: A separate DP/integer reconstruction also returns `1539`, reinforcing that the mask DP is implemented consistently.
- Token 5144 [missed opportunity]: After the sample check and target computation align, the trace could have finalized instead of continuing with more confirmations.
- Token 5703-6258 [wasted]: Extended exact-vs-mod cross-checking on additional cases repeats already-established correctness without changing the approach.
- Token 6612 [verification]: Recomputes the large case with exact big integers and gets the same modulo value, confirming end-to-end consistency.
- Token 6855 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{819963842}`; this final answer is correct.
