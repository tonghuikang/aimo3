## Answer: correct (24493)

## Key moments
- Token 204 [insight]: Correctly rules out any fixed point with `n>m` because `M(n)=n-s` and `s>=1`.
- Token 476 [questionable statement]: Hypothesizes the classical behavior (`M(n)=m-s+1` for all `n<=m`) might hold regardless of `k`.
- Token 4994-5894 [wasted]: Spends substantial effort debugging recursion/termination behavior in ad hoc code instead of isolating the fixed-point arithmetic condition.
- Token 5922 [mistake]: Proceeds as if that constant-output claim were generally true, which does not hold for many `(k,s)` pairs.
- Token 7410 [questionable statement]: Proposes an unconditional contiguous fixed-point block `[m-s+1, m-s+d]` (with `d=k-s`), only truncated at `m`.
- Token 8069 [missed opportunity]: Treats overflow past `m` as truncation-only behavior rather than testing congruence/divisibility structure earlier.
- Token 8809 [mistake]: Counterexamples show that block rule fails (cycles can appear with no fixed points), so the prior condition is insufficient.
- Token 10549 [insight]: Identifies the likely missing arithmetic constraint: `d` dividing `s`.
- Token 13073 [insight]: Establishes the decisive criterion: fixed points exist iff `(k-s) | s`; otherwise `F_{m,k,s}` is empty.
- Token 13482 [breakthrough]: Converts that criterion into closed-form `SF`: `d(m-s+1)+d(d-1)/2` when `s % d = 0`, else `0`.
- Token 15351 [verification]: Validates the summation formula against both provided checks (`S(10,10)` and `S(1000,1000)`).
- Token 17966 [verification]: Recomputes via both modular and full-sum paths and confirms the same residue.
- Token 18340 [final answer]: Final commitment is `\boxed{24493}`.
