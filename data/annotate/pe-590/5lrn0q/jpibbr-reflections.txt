## Answer: wrong (325878784)

## Key moments
- Token 245 [insight]: Recasts the problem as counting subsets of divisors whose coordinatewise max exponent vector equals that of \(L(50000)\).
- Token 992 [breakthrough]: Sets up inclusion-exclusion over primes whose top exponent is missing.
- Token 2237 [insight]: Obtains the key term size \(M(I)=\prod_{i\in I}e_i\prod_{i\notin I}(e_i+1)\), enabling the subset-sum formula.
- Token 3053 [verification]: Correctly separates modulus handling into \(2^9\) and \(5^9\), with exponent reduction mod \(\varphi(5^9)=1562500\).
- Token 9840 [insight]: Splits primes into \(P1\) (\(e_i=1\), \(r1=5085\)) and \(P2\) (\(e_i>1\), 48 primes), reducing structure complexity.
- Token 12318 [breakthrough]: Derives the nested sum over \(J\subseteq P2\) and \(s\in[0,r1]\), which is the right computational form.
- Token 13149 [insight]: Uses DP over \(c_J \bmod \varphi(5^9)\) to avoid \(2^{48}\) enumeration.
- Token 17797 [verification]: Correctly proves the \( \bmod\,512 \) component is zero for \(N=50000\) because \(c_J\ge 2^{48}>9\).
- Token 26232 [questionable statement]: Introduces “binomial coefficients iteratively mod mod” inside the \(s\)-loop.
- Token 26232 [mistake]: Applies `C %= mod` before the next exact recurrence step `C = C*(r1-s)//(s+1)`, which invalidates large-\(s\) binomial coefficients under composite modulus.
- Token 27388 [missed opportunity]: Validation focuses on small \(n\) where coefficients stay below \(5^9\), so the recurrence bug remains hidden.
- Token 32536-35982 [wasted]: Long diagnostic loop around full-mod vs split-mod behavior without auditing the broken binomial-update invariant.
- Token 35982 [questionable statement]: Treats residual discrepancies as sufficiently explained by modulus splitting, without re-validating coefficient generation.
- Token 36615 [mistake]: Declares the numerical result reliable despite the unresolved coefficient-generation flaw.
- Token 40146 [verification]: Re-checks CRT congruence consistency (`a2`, divisibility by 512), but only within the same flawed pipeline.
- Token 41314 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{325878784}\), which is incorrect.
