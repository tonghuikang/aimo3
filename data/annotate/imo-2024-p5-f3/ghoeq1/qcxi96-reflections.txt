## Answer: wrong (4)

## Key moments
- Token 623 [insight]: Correctly identifies that exactly one of four columns is globally monster-free.
- Token 1568 [questionable statement]: Starts from the assumption that worst-case guarantee is mainly “eliminate unsafe columns one by one.”
- Token 2896 [missed opportunity]: Reaches the exact two-known-monster / two-unknown-column state but does not attempt the known-column detour construction that wins in attempt 3.
- Token 3747 [insight]: Shifts to a cleaner adversarial lower-bound framing instead of pure simulation.
- Token 4338 [breakthrough]: Generalizes to the candidate formula `f(k)=k+1`, which becomes the backbone of the final argument.
- Token 4601 [mistake]: Claims that two unknown columns after `k-1` failures necessarily force another failure, ignoring row-specific routing information in the `k=3` case.
- Token 4958 [questionable statement]: Sets up an adversarial construction based only on columns ever hit by failures, abstracting away path geometry.
- Token 5005 [mistake]: Uses that abstraction to declare all `<=k`-attempt guarantees impossible, yielding an invalid lower bound for this instance.
- Token 5218-5394 [wasted]: Long general-`k` wrap-up without validating the `k=3` special structure against explicit counter-strategies.
- Token 5406 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{4}`, which is incorrect.
