## Answer: correct (3)

## Key moments
- Token 876 [insight]: Identifies the invariant that one of the four columns is globally monster-free.
- Token 2075 [questionable statement]: Starts relying on a coarse adversarial-elimination heuristic (“one blocked column per failure”) to estimate the lower bound.
- Token 3957 [mistake]: Leans to `f(3)=4` from that heuristic without fully exploiting row-specific information after two failures.
- Token 4313 [insight]: Refines the state after two failures to the right uncertainty model: one remaining row and two candidate columns.
- Token 9603 [breakthrough]: Builds a constructive detour argument showing the third attempt can always cross the unknown row safely and reach bottom.
- Token 10432 [verification]: Analyzes the `n=2` possibility and argues one known monster cannot guarantee a universal second-attempt win.
- Token 12023-12970 [wasted]: Digresses into brute-force/cutset setup and code scaffolding instead of finalizing a direct proof.
- Token 17454 [questionable statement]: Reopens the possibility of `f(3)=2` via a universal path after one failure, requiring another long re-check.
- Token 19148 [verification]: Cross-shape/safe-region analysis confirms no universal second-attempt path exists for all consistent placements, locking in `f(3) >= 3`.
- Token 19853 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{3}`, which is correct.
