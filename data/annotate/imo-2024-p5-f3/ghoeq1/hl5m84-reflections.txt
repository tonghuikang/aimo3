## Answer: correct (3)

## Key moments
- Token 865 [insight]: Correctly identifies the unique globally safe column implied by distinct monster columns.
- Token 4438 [questionable statement]: Treats the two-column ambiguity after two failures as if it necessarily forces another sacrificial test.
- Token 4688 [mistake]: Concludes a third death is required to resolve ambiguity, pushing toward `f(3)=4`.
- Token 9145-11442 [wasted]: Extended case-by-case detours on the “unknown row = 3” configuration without exploiting a cleaner symmetric construction.
- Token 11747 [insight]: Reframes the task into the right proof split: show `f(3) >= 3` and construct a guaranteed `<= 3` strategy.
- Token 12949 [breakthrough]: Gives an explicit third-attempt algorithm using two known monster columns/rows and a controlled switch row.
- Token 13180 [verification]: Validates row-by-row safety of the constructed switches in the `r1 < r2` case.
- Token 14025 [verification]: Confirms that if attempts 1 and 2 both fail on different columns, the deaths must occur in distinct rows, enabling the third-attempt construction.
- Token 14249 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{3}`, which is correct.
