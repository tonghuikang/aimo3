Problem: PE 601 - Divisibility Streaks

Correct Answer: 17387

Problem Summary:
- streak(n) = smallest positive integer k such that n+k is not divisible by k+1
- P(s,N) = count of n with 1 < n < N where streak(n) = s
- Goal: Find sum_{i=1}^{31} P(i, 4^i) mod 99991

Key Insight:
- n+k divisible by k+1 iff n ≡ -k ≡ 1 (mod k+1)
- streak(n) = s iff:
  (i) n ≡ 1 (mod M_s) where M_s = lcm(2,3,...,s)
  (ii) n ≢ 1 (mod s+1)

Formula:
- P(s,N) = floor((N-2)/M_s) - floor((N-2)/M_{s+1})
- Note: M_{s+1} = lcm(M_s, s+1)

Computation:
- Precompute M_i = lcm(2,...,i) for i up to 32
- For each i from 1 to 31: compute P(i, 4^i) using the formula
- Sum all values and take mod 99991

Final Sum: 1,617,243
Final Answer: 1,617,243 mod 99991 = 17387
