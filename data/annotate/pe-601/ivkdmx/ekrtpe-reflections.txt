## Answer: correct (17387)

## Key moments
- Token 155 [insight]: Rewrites the divisibility condition into congruences `n \equiv 1 \pmod{j+1}`, which is the source idea for using LCMs.
- Token 666 [breakthrough]: Consolidates the streak condition into `n \equiv 1 \pmod{M_s}` and `n \not\equiv 1 \pmod{s+1}`, turning the task into a counting problem.
- Token 1213 [insight]: Recognizes the overlap structure between `n \equiv 1 \pmod{M_s}` and `n \equiv 1 \pmod{s+1}`, preparing the subtraction-by-intersection count.
- Token 1351 [breakthrough]: Expresses `P(s,N)` as a difference of two congruence-class counts, enabling a direct floor-formula computation.
- Token 3051 [questionable statement]: Defines `Ls` only through index 31 (`range(0,32)`) while later code accesses `Ls[i+1]` up to `i=31`.
- Token 3586 [mistake]: Calls `compute_sum()` and hits an `IndexError` from the missing `L_32` entry.
- Token 3664 [insight]: Corrects the setup by extending the precomputed LCM list to include index 32.
- Token 3870 [breakthrough]: Re-runs the corrected computation and gets the target pair `(1617243, 17387)`.
- Token 4315 [verification]: Checks the known sample `P(3,14)=1`, confirming the counting formulation.
- Token 4361 [verification]: Checks the second sample `P(6,10^6)=14286`, further validating correctness.
- Token 4483-4580 [verification]: Cross-validates formula vs brute force for `i=1..8`; all values match.
- Token 4728-5330 [wasted]: Performs several additional redundant confirmations (full list dump, repeated modulo check, brute checks at `i=10` and `i=12`) after the result is already established.
- Token 5378 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{17387}`.
