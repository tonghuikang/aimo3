# Problem pe-439 Findings

## Problem Statement
Let d(k) be the sum of all divisors of k (i.e., sigma function).
Define S(N) = sum_{i=1}^N sum_{j=1}^N d(i*j).
Find S(10^11) mod 10^9.

## Correct Answer
968697378

## Given Test Values
- S(10^3) = 563576517282
- S(10^5) mod 10^9 = 215766508

## Key Formula
Use the divisor-sum identity
sigma(i*j) = sum_{d|i, e|j, gcd(d,e)=1} d*e

which gives
S(N) = sum_{d=1}^N sum_{e=1}^N [gcd(d,e)=1] * d * e * floor(N/d) * floor(N/e)

Applying Möbius inversion on the coprimality constraint:
S(N) = sum_{k=1}^N mu(k) * B(k)^2

where B(k) = sum_{t=1}^{floor(N/k)} (k*t) * floor(N/(k*t))

and
sum_{i=1}^M i * floor(M/i) = sum_{n=1}^M sigma(n)

Equivalent working form:
S(N) = sum_{e=1}^N mu(e) * e * A(floor(N/e))^2
with
A(x) = sum_{n=1}^x sigma(n) = sum_{i=1}^x i * floor(x/i)

## Algorithm Complexity
An O(N^{2/3})-style implementation (memoized divide-and-conquer / Min_25-style summatory evaluation) is needed for N=10^11.

## Wrong Approaches
- Misreading d(k) as tau(k) (number of divisors) instead of sigma(k) (sum of divisors).
- Assuming an invalid unique coprime split of divisors of i*j (this breaks when i and j share prime factors).
- Guessing phi-based closed forms from small-N numerics without proof.
- Building incomplete/incorrect fast summation DP (especially prime-sum correction/base handling), then guessing.

## Wrong Traces
- 5glaih.txt - Ends with guessed answer 0 after failing to complete/validate the fast algorithm.
- d41q14.txt - Ends with guessed answer 0 after incorrect derivation and no validated computation.
