# Problem pe-813: XOR-product P(8^12 * 12^8) mod 10^9+7

## Correct answer
- 14063639

## Correct approach
- Interpret XOR-product as carryless multiplication, i.e. polynomial multiplication over GF(2).
- With 11 = 1011_2, use f(x) = x^3 + x + 1, so P(n) is the binary integer from f(x)^n over GF(2).
- Compute the exponent:
  - n = 8^12 * 12^8 = 2^52 * 3^8 = 2^52 * 6561.
- Use Frobenius in characteristic 2:
  - (f(x))^(2^k) = f(x^(2^k)).
  - Therefore f(x)^n = (1 + x^(2^52) + x^(3*2^52))^6561.
- Let T = 2^52. If (1 + y + y^3)^6561 = sum c_s y^s (c_s in {0,1}), then
  - P(n) = sum_{c_s=1} 2^(sT).
- Evaluate modulo M = 10^9+7 using the multiplicative order of 2:
  - ord_M(2) = 500000003, so exponents can be reduced mod 500000003.
- Computing the GF(2) polynomial for the odd part (6561) and evaluating gives 14063639.

## Wrong approaches and why they fail
- Treating P(n) as ordinary multiplication 11^n is wrong.
  - Example: P(2)=69, but 11^2=121.
- Incorrect factorizations of x^3+x+1 (e.g., as (x+1)^3 or (1+x)(1+x^2)) are false; both introduce an x^2 term.
- Reducing operands modulo 10^9+7 during carryless multiplication is invalid:
  - (a ⊗ b) mod M is not preserved by replacing a,b with a mod M,b mod M.
- Working only with parity after reducing exponents mod L via GF(2)[x]/(x^L-1) is insufficient for final mod-M value, because the final sum needs integer multiplicities of surviving exponents, not just parity by residue class.

## Trace-level outcome
- Both traces for this state reach the correct final value 14063639.
