## Answer: correct (161)

## Key moments
- Token 258 [wasted]: Restates the goal without structural insight.
- Token 584-613 [insight]: Recognizes the task can be reframed as minimizing the LCM over divisor triples with fixed sum.
- Token 633-651 [breakthrough]: Explicitly commits to `f(n)=min lcm(a,b,c)` over distinct triples summing to `n`.
- Token 1891 [wasted]: Explores the a=1 / n−1 divisor heuristic without tying to n’s divisors.
- Token 3468-3518 [wasted]: Brute-forces small n for pattern hints.
- Token 6088-6137 [insight]: Moves to congruence analysis on `n=M+c`, setting up small-prime elimination.
- Token 6296-6310 [breakthrough]: Uses congruences to rule out `3|n`, narrowing possible small divisors.
- Token 7600 [wasted]: Checks small-mod behavior without extracting concrete divisors of n.
- Token 9636-9703 [wasted]: Analyzes ratio r(x,y) abstractly, not yet linked to divisibility.
- Token 10997-11037 [insight]: Introduces the chain-parameter objective `kℓ/(1+k+kℓ)` that links ratio minimization to a divisor denominator.
- Token 11148-11231 [breakthrough]: Derives `D=1+k+kℓ | n` and `f(n)=n·(kℓ/D)` for admissible constructions.
- Token 13068-13083 [wasted]: Minor modular checks (c%10) while preparing divisor search.
- Token 11291-11312 [insight]: Identifies that only divisors `D` of the form `1+k+kℓ` matter, preparing closed-form ratio comparisons.
- Token 15007-15062 [breakthrough]: Gets the reduced ratio expression for the `D-1` multiple-of-3 branch.
- Token 16950-17194 [insight]: Observes minimal ratio should come from the smallest admissible divisor `D` of `n`, motivating direct divisor scan.
- Token 17194-17209 [breakthrough]: Switches to explicit search over admissible divisors `D|n`.
- Token 18717-18818 [insight]: Narrows the practical search to small admissible `D` values first, anticipating that the best ratio appears early.
- Token 19016-19199 [breakthrough]: Compares candidate D (7,9,10,…) and notes ratio depends on D−1 factors.
- Token 21028-21037 [verification]: Sets up modular exponent reduction to test divisibility efficiently.
- Token 23011-23043 [verification]: Implements modular tests for small D divisibility.
- Token 23925-24035 [insight]: Computes `k,ℓ` induced by `D=97` and sees the resulting numerator candidate `64`.
- Token 24035-24069 [breakthrough]: Confirms `D=97` gives `f(n)=(64/97)n`.
- Token 25981-26037 [verification]: Checks that excluded D (with D−1 prime) cannot yield a valid chain triple, reinforcing the D=97 choice.
- Token 26742 [final answer]: States g=64/97 and p+q=161.
