## Answer: wrong (8)

## Key moments
- Token 95 [wasted]: Restates the goal and g(c) definition.
- Token 508-608 [insight]: Derives the divisibility condition `d|(k-1)` for triples of the form `{1,d,X}`.
- Token 608 [breakthrough]: Establishes a valid constructive family `{1,d,X}` with `X=k-1-d`.
- Token 4001-4093 [wasted]: Uses size bounds (sum ≤ 11X/6) to argue X≈M/2, but no optimization criterion.
- Token 7474-7500 [insight]: Identifies that increasing `a+b` can lower `X`, motivating an algebraic reformulation.
- Token 7604-7657 [breakthrough]: Introduces the factorization identity `(a+1)(b+1)=k+1` as a new candidate family.
- Token 10002-10067 [wasted]: Over-focuses on `k+1` factorizations without proving global optimality for `f(k)`.
- Token 12209-12326 [questionable statement]: Variable bookkeeping around `c0,C,c+1` becomes inconsistent.
- Token 12375-12491 [mistake]: Applies modular divisibility tests to the wrong shifted constant, corrupting later divisor conclusions.
- Token 17084-17183 [questionable statement]: Treats the product-family estimate as if it were close to globally optimal evidence.
- Token 17183-17306 [mistake]: Concludes `p=3` gives the global minimum (`~2k/3`) while ignoring lower-ratio constructions.
- Token 20001-20095 [missed opportunity]: Notes the 6/11 ratio possibility but doesn’t test whether 11 divides k.
- Token 22004-22064 [wasted]: Computes M mod 17 and other small primes without tying to correct divisor structure.
- Token 26809-26874 [questionable statement]: Treats the `(p,q)=(2,6)` branch as effectively dominant once divisibility by 5 is seen.
- Token 27003-27304 [mistake]: Commits to `X=3k/5` as the best achievable ratio and propagates `g=3/5`.
- Token 29005-29039 [wasted]: Runs small-case checks but does not revisit the flawed framework.
- Token 32049-32075 [missed opportunity]: Proposes brute `(p,q)` search instead of switching to `L_min(s)/s` over divisors `s|n`.
- Token 35008-35040 [wasted]: Continues bounds on D/g within the incorrect p,q framework.
- Token 37878 [verification]: Mentions a potential small simulation but does not execute or correct the error.
- Token 37986 [final answer]: Outputs p+q=8 (from g=3/5), which is incorrect.
