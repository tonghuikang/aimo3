## Answer: wrong (7)

## Key moments
- Token 118 [wasted]: Restates the goal and g(c) definition without progress.
- Token 578-645 [questionable statement]: Treats the `a=1` triple as likely optimal before establishing any global minimization argument.
- Token 645-778 [mistake]: Reduces the problem to `f(n)=min lcm(a,b)` with `a+b=n-1`, incorrectly excluding non-`1` triples.
- Token 890-920 [wasted]: Doubles down on the pair-sum formulation instead of validating against full triple search.
- Token 945-1349 [questionable statement]: Acknowledges triples without `1` might help, but still assumes they can be ignored.
- Token 2067-2106 [mistake]: Re-asserts the pair-only formula as the main objective, locking in the wrong model.
- Token 3109-3241 [wasted]: Develops `L=N-g` algebra entirely inside that incorrect reduction.
- Token 5255-5665 [questionable statement]: Switches focus to divisors of `N=n-1`, which is unrelated to the needed divisor structure of `n=M+c`.
- Token 6249 [missed opportunity]: Runs modular checks but does not pivot to factoring `c+1`, the key route to divisors of `n`.
- Token 6286-6568 [mistake]: Infers `g*=N/4` from the wrong divisor target (`N`), producing the wrong candidate `f(n)=3N/4`.
- Token 7147-7297 [wasted]: Additional modular testing on the same wrong target quantity.
- Token 8040-8095 [questionable statement]: Frames `N/4` as effectively forced without cross-checking alternative valid constructions.
- Token 8095-8131 [mistake]: Commits to `L=3N/4` and propagates it into `g(c)=3/4`.
- Token 10395-10457 [verification]: Verifies floor arithmetic for `3/4` correctly, but only for the already-wrong `f(n)` input.
- Token 11162-11463 [wasted]: Attempts to justify excluding `g=N/2`, but still never exits the flawed pair-sum framework.
- Token 12001-12075 [wasted]: Late numerical tests fail to test the correct divisor-based optimization.
- Token 12840-12857 [wasted]: Finalization language appears without repairing the core modeling error.
- Token 13557-13589 [verification]: Repeats the reduced fraction `3/4` from the wrong branch.
- Token 13617 [final answer]: Final output is `p+q=7`, which is incorrect.
