## Answer: correct (24)

## Key moments
- Token 511 [insight]: Reframes the shift inner-product condition as a convolution equation, enabling polynomial-factor reasoning.
- Token 2699 [breakthrough]: Models shiftyness as divisibility of a two-monomial binomial in `\mathbb{Z}[x,x^{-1}]`, reducing the search to admissible factor families.
- Token 5534 [questionable statement]: Uses an overgeneralized `x^n+1` cyclotomic-factor pattern that ignores the even-`n` 2-adic constraint.
- Token 12172 [questionable statement]: Keeps `\Phi_2\Phi_4` (`(x+1)(x^2+1)`) as a valid degree-3 base candidate despite unresolved parity compatibility.
- Token 17986 [mistake]: Commits to the inflated count `26` from the invalid candidate family.
- Token 17986 [missed opportunity]: Could have immediately checked the `n=2` case to see `x^2+1` lacks the `\Phi_2` factor, which would have invalidated `\Phi_2\Phi_4` earlier.
- Token 19977-32690 [wasted]: Long brute-force and debugging detour while the core issue was still the incorrect divisor-index formula.
- Token 29246 [insight]: The mismatch between predicted and computed candidate sets surfaces a structural contradiction that motivates re-deriving the factorization condition.
- Token 33022 [breakthrough]: Re-derives `x^n+1 = \prod_{d\mid 2n,\,d\nmid n}\Phi_d` with the correct 2-adic interpretation, resolving the earlier inconsistency.
- Token 33768 [verification]: Explicitly proves `\Phi_2` and `\Phi_4` cannot co-occur for one `x^n+1`, eliminating the bad branch.
- Token 35366 [verification]: Recounts with corrected admissible bases and obtains `24`.
- Token 37053 [verification]: Additional bounded search confirms no hidden high-magnitude coefficient solutions.
- Token 38696 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{24}`.
