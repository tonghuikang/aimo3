## Answer: correct (24)

## Key moments
- Token 739 [insight]: Reinterprets the shift-dot-product condition as convolution with a reversed version of `\beta`.
- Token 3211 [breakthrough]: Converts the problem to polynomial divisibility: `A(x)Q(x)=x^m+x^n=x^m(1+x^d)`.
- Token 3575-4259 [wasted]: Spends many tokens re-deriving exponent-shift normalization and Laurent/polynomial bookkeeping after the core equivalence is already established.
- Token 9632 [questionable statement]: Briefly explores odd-index cyclotomic possibilities (like `\Phi_3`) before fully enforcing the even-index condition for `x^n+1` factors.
- Token 10462 [breakthrough]: Correctly narrows quadratic irreducible options to `\Phi_4(x)=x^2+1` and `\Phi_6(x)=x^2-x+1`, excluding `\Phi_3`.
- Token 13639 [breakthrough]: Finalizes the complete low-degree divisor family `g\in\{1,x+1,x^2+1,x^2-x+1,x^3+1\}`.
- Token 15876 [verification]: Gives a constructive existence proof for `\beta` via `1+x^d=g(x)h(x)` and `A(x)=x^s g(x)`.
- Token 18375 [verification]: Verifies the count decomposition `8+6+4+4+2=24` and checks distinctness classes.
- Token 18999 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{24}`.
