## Answer: wrong (26)

## Key moments
- Token 1286 [insight]: Correctly reformulates the condition via generating functions and convolution coefficients.
- Token 1754 [breakthrough]: Reduces the target to Laurent divisibility of a binomial form `x^k(1+x^d)`.
- Token 5530 [breakthrough]: Sharpens the structure to `\alpha=x^pD` with primitive `D` dividing some `1+x^d`.
- Token 7671 [missed opportunity]: Notes that not all cyclotomic subsets are simultaneously realizable for one `d`, but never carries this constraint through to counting.
- Token 9116 [questionable statement]: Treats products from subsets of `{\Phi_2,\Phi_4,\Phi_6}` as broadly admissible once degree is small.
- Token 9183 [mistake]: Keeps `\Phi_2\Phi_4` as a valid branch, despite incompatible divisibility conditions for `1+x^d`.
- Token 9284 [questionable statement]: Continues listing `\pm(\Phi_2\Phi_4)` among allowable primitive divisors.
- Token 9895 [verification]: Performs concrete checks for monomial (`D=1`) cases and sign handling, which are valid partial checks.
- Token 11184-11981 [wasted]: Spends a long segment on duplicate/collision analysis before resolving the unresolved feasibility of the `\Phi_2\Phi_4` branch.
- Token 16193 [mistake]: Explicitly counts `D=\Phi_2\Phi_4` as two shifty functions, inflating the total.
- Token 16695 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{26}`.
