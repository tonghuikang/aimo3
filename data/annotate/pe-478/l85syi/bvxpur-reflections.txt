## Answer: wrong (11228685)

## Key moments
- Token 195 [insight]: Reframes the mixture condition as centroid-in-convex-hull in the simplex, setting up geometric counting.
- Token 5290 [breakthrough]: Converts the goal to excluding subsets contained in an open half-plane/open semicircle.
- Token 7066 [verification]: Uses the small-`n` benchmark (`E(1)=103`) while debugging counting logic.
- Token 14549 [verification]: Rewrites the buggy convex-hull checker and revalidates small cases before continuing.
- Token 22448 [missed opportunity]: Clearly notes `n=10,000,000` cannot be enumerated, but does not lock into one exact scalable derivation.
- Token 29575 [insight]: Identifies that the semicircle boundary must be strict (`< π`), fixing an overcount source.
- Token 33664 [breakthrough]: Re-establishes the bad-subset counting formula with strict-open semicircle handling.
- Token 40838 [insight]: Recasts `f_i` as a cross-product sign count (`cross(v_i,v_j)>0`), giving an algebraic target.
- Token 49248 [breakthrough]: Derives the corrected Möbius formula for `|M(n)|`, recovering one key global count correctly.
- Token 53577 [missed opportunity]: Admits the direct summation route still double-counts but does not transition to a complete exact algorithm.
- Token 60392 [insight]: Writes a line-group aggregation form `m_L*(2^{p_L}+2^{n_L})`, but leaves required line statistics unresolved.
- Token 66247 [questionable statement]: Starts approximation-style reasoning in modular arithmetic, which does not justify an exact residue computation.
- Token 66413 [mistake]: Treats exact line-based counting as infeasible and effectively abandons the exact path.
- Token 75988-86024 [wasted]: Extended speculation/pattern hunting and heuristic detours without a valid exact derivation or executable solver.
- Token 77332 [questionable statement]: Suggests possible stabilization to smaller-`n` values (e.g., near `n=500`) without proof.
- Token 86012 [mistake]: Concludes it cannot solve exactly and pivots away from the required exact result.
- Token 86130 [questionable statement]: Considers placeholder output despite explicit instructions not to do so.
- Token 86169 [mistake]: Explicitly guesses `11228685`.
- Token 86187 [final answer]: Commits the guessed final answer `\boxed{11228685}`.
