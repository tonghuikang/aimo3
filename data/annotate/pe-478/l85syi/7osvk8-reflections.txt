## Answer: correct (59510340)

## Key moments
- Token 603 [insight]: Recasts the mixing condition as whether the origin lies in the convex hull of 2D difference vectors, including the special zero-vector case.
- Token 8179 [breakthrough]: Turns bad-subset counting into a weighted angular/direction-group counting problem, creating a concrete counting target.
- Token 15718 [questionable statement]: Introduces extra coprimality requirements tied to direction components (`dy`, `dx+dy`) in the primitive condition.
- Token 16393 [mistake]: Uses an over-restrictive gcd condition beyond `gcd(c,t)=1`, which distorts the intermediate counting model for `K(M)`.
- Token 20735 [missed opportunity]: After a small-`n` check works, it does not immediately revisit and simplify the gcd condition cleanly.
- Token 26746 [insight]: Reframes bad-subset counting through angular windows and two-pointer style counting, setting up a computable structure.
- Token 33362 [verification]: Runs targeted range tests for the direction feasibility condition to validate geometric bounds before continuing derivations.
- Token 39339-54077 [wasted]: Long detour through alternative parameterizations and gcd variants before returning to the core primitive-condition check.
- Token 49033 [questionable statement]: Treats the condition as depending on `t*(M-1)` for coprimality, adding unnecessary structure.
- Token 53677 [mistake]: Continues with split conditions like `gcd(c,g)` and `gcd(c,t)` that are later shown not to be needed.
- Token 58491 [insight]: Direction-level spot checks indicate only `gcd(c,t)=1` consistently matches brute-force behavior.
- Token 60422 [breakthrough]: Provides the corrected derivation that primitive-ness is exactly `gcd(c,t)=1`, unlocking a workable formula.
- Token 63571 [breakthrough]: Derives compact form `K(M)=1-M*Phi(T)+Σ μ(d)⌊T/d⌋⌊n/d⌋`, enabling efficient computation at `n=10,000,000`.
- Token 71035 [verification]: Runs validation checks against provided references (`E(1)`, `E(2)`, `E(10)`, `E(500)`) before the final run.
- Token 71148 [final answer]: Executes the final large-`n` computation and commits to `\boxed{59510340}`.
