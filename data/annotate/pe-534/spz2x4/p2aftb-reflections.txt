## Answer: correct (75393)

## Key moments
- Token 148 [questionable statement]: The trace initially frames placements as a permutation model, which is risky because weak-queen rules allow repeated columns at large enough row distance.
- Token 497 [mistake]: It briefly reasons with permutation-style column uniqueness before fully reconciling that the correct object is a general row-to-column function.
- Token 695 [insight]: It fixes the representation and explicitly allows repeated columns when separations exceed \(D\), aligning the model with the actual attack rule.
- Token 6582 [insight]: It identifies that checking only the last \(d\) rows is sufficient for each new placement, setting up a finite-memory DP.
- Token 7308 [breakthrough]: It concretely specifies and implements the tuple-state DP (`count_M`) over recent columns and validates it on \(n=4,5\).
- Token 8911-12729 [wasted]: After hitting runtime limits, the trace spends a long stretch on alternate derivations and reformulations without producing new numeric progress.
- Token 12901 [missed opportunity]: It recognizes that a hybrid strategy for high \(D\) is likely needed, but delays switching to an executable alternative.
- Token 15994 [insight]: It reframes large-\(D\) cases as "almost full N-Queens constraints" and proposes memoized backtracking as the practical path.
- Token 16838 [breakthrough]: It implements `count_M_backtrack`, obtains hard values for difficult \(D\) cases, and enables a complete \(D=0\ldots13\) run.
- Token 17980 [verification]: It executes the full sweep and gets \(S(14)\bmod 99991=75393\).
- Token 18653 [verification]: It performs an independent construction for \(D=12\) (relaxing only the farthest pair) and matches the prior modulo result.
- Token 22581 [verification]: It cross-checks the method against brute-force for \(n=6,7\), confirming the DP/backtracking logic.
- Token 23668 [final answer]: It commits to \(\boxed{75393}\).
