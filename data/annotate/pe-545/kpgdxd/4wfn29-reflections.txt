## Answer: correct (90471)

## Key moments
- Token 230 [insight]: Moves to Bernoulli-number form of Faulhaber sums, which is the right path to isolate `a_1`.
- Token 511 [questionable statement]: Locks to a `B_1=-1/2` convention while also using a formula variant that is sign-sensitive at `k=1`.
- Token 1218 [breakthrough]: Correctly derives `a_1 = B_k`, reducing the denominator question to Bernoulli denominators.
- Token 1301 [mistake]: Treats the `k=1` sign mismatch as a contradiction in the core derivation instead of a convention mismatch.
- Token 1612 [breakthrough]: Reconciles Bernoulli conventions (`B_1=+1/2` for this form), resolving the earlier inconsistency.
- Token 2102 [breakthrough]: Applies von Staudt-Clausen to connect `D(k)` to primes satisfying `(p-1) | k`.
- Token 3004 [insight]: States the exact target-set condition: primes with `(p-1)|k` must be exactly `{2,3,5,23,29}`.
- Token 3336 [breakthrough]: Computes the mandatory base multiple `k` divisible by `lcm(1,2,4,22,28)=308`.
- Token 4266 [missed opportunity]: Announces brute-force/pattern search but does not immediately implement the direct acceptance test.
- Token 6115-6652 [wasted]: Long decomposition discussion about divisors of `L*t` without improving the acceptance criterion or producing code.
- Token 15474 [questionable statement]: Starts overinterpreting “forbidden prime” evidence as if admissible `t` might collapse almost completely.
- Token 15775 [mistake]: Pushes that line of reasoning toward conflict with given data (`F(10)=96404`) before correcting course.
- Token 18626 [insight]: Uses the `t=313` example to spot that “prime divides forbidden `h`” is too strong.
- Token 19817 [breakthrough]: Corrects the sieve condition to the right one: `t` is forbidden only when a full forbidden `h` divides `t`.
- Token 20181-21442 [wasted]: Extended abstract discussion of density/minimal sets after the correct divisibility condition is already known.
- Token 22076 [missed opportunity]: Keeps estimating densities and bounds instead of committing directly to the per-`t` divisor/primality test.
- Token 24371 [insight]: Identifies the practical check `for each divisor d of t and g|308, test primality of g*d+1`.
- Token 31966 [missed opportunity]: Spends additional time on heavier global-sieve planning despite already having a viable local test.
- Token 34099 [breakthrough]: Finalizes the executable per-`t` divisor algorithm that scales to the 100,000th valid index.
- Token 36690 [verification]: Checks intermediate milestones (`100`, `1000`, `10000`) for consistency of generated admissible `t`.
- Token 37025 [verification]: Runs the `100000` target computation with an expanded bound and gets `t=2990609`.
- Token 37994 [verification]: Performs extra counting/index checks up to `t=3,000,000` to eliminate indexing/bound errors.
- Token 38883 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{90471}`.
