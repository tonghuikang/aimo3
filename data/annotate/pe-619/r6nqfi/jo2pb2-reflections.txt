## Answer: correct (857810883)

## Key moments
- Token 109 [insight]: Reframes the condition as parity of prime exponents, modeling each number as a GF(2) vector.
- Token 253 [breakthrough]: Derives the core counting rule \(2^{N-\text{rank}}-1\) from the nullspace dimension argument.
- Token 1738 [questionable statement]: Overfocuses on storing all vectors at once, which is not needed for streamed basis insertion.
- Token 1928-2345 [wasted]: Long detour on representing vectors via squarefree integers vs bitsets before committing to one implementation.
- Token 3783 [verification]: Implements `compute_C` and verifies on the small checks, including \(C(5,10)=3\) and \(C(40,55)=15\).
- Token 4312 [verification]: Confirms the second checkpoint \(C(1000,1234)\bmod 10^9+7=975523611\).
- Token 4545 [verification]: Runs the target interval computation and gets `Ans: 857810883, Rank: 58242, N: 234568`.
- Token 5206-5688 [wasted]: Continues extended memory speculation after already obtaining the target result.
- Token 6062 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{857810883}\), which is correct.
