## Answer: wrong (9904)

## Key moments
- Token 1490 [insight]: Starts from the right structural objective: minimize the witness integer via divisor-sum constraints.
- Token 7177 [insight]: Narrows attention to odd-prime divisors of `s-1` for the `(1,d,N)` construction.
- Token 12136 [insight]: Writes the modular condition `p | (M+c-1)` that drives candidate-prime testing.
- Token 15089 [verification]: Computes concrete floor components for the first candidate branch and keeps arithmetic symbolic.
- Token 23060 [verification]: Runs additional computations to reconcile candidate formulas with brute checks.
- Token 25160 [verification]: Brute-force testing on small `s` exposes many mismatches against the claimed closed form.
- Token 25476 [missed opportunity]: Notes those mismatches but treats them as small-`s` artifacts instead of revising the global minimization model.
- Token 28726 [questionable statement]: Re-asserts `f(s)=(s-1)(p-1)/p` (with `p` smallest odd prime divisor) as the general odd-`s` minimum.
- Token 29037 [mistake]: Commits to that formula as globally minimal, excluding better constructions not captured by the `(1,d,N)` family.
- Token 31872 [insight]: Correctly simplifies small-prime divisibility to `p | c` when `M ≡ 1 (mod p)`.
- Token 32083 [breakthrough]: Uses that to pin `p1=5081287` and `p2=29` under the chosen (but wrong) model.
- Token 33320 [insight]: Splits the floor analysis into `p>2025` vs `p<=2025`, fixing an off-by-one issue inside the model.
- Token 33947 [breakthrough]: Produces a clean piecewise formula for `g(c)` with the `δ` correction term.
- Token 40441-43288 [wasted]: Long detour debugging contradictory remainders while still assuming the incorrect `f(s)` formula.
- Token 47303 [verification]: Re-derives `g` via exact-floor expressions and confirms internal consistency.
- Token 51437 [verification]: Final consistency check of derived symbolic formulas before committing output.
- Token 53206 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{9904}` (incorrect).
