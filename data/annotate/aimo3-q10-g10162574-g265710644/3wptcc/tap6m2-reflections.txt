## Answer: wrong (7)

## Key moments
- Token 5609 [insight]: Builds an early `n-1`-based minimization formula from divisor structure.
- Token 13454 [verification]: Small-`n` brute tests expose that the current closed form is not universally correct.
- Token 21769 [breakthrough]: Revises the `n-1` branch with a cleaner smallest-divisor characterization.
- Token 27817 [questionable statement]: Reasserts that branch as effectively governing the huge-`n` target regime.
- Token 34083 [verification]: Rechecks computations and re-anchors on the same over-restrictive branch.
- Token 41405 [insight]: Recognizes the model so far only covers sums of form `1+a+b`, opening room for other families.
- Token 45893 [questionable statement]: Still leans on the idea that the old smallest-divisor scheme should dominate for large `n`.
- Token 50077 [insight]: Explicitly pivots to searching constructions that do not include divisor `1`.
- Token 51616 [insight]: Derives the `n+1` factorization route `ab=n+1` and corresponding candidate `N=(a-1)(b-1)`.
- Token 55026 [questionable statement]: Treats the `a=3` choice in that route as globally decisive for the full optimization.
- Token 57656 [breakthrough]: Finds a valid `2/3`-type construction for both target offsets.
- Token 57863 [mistake]: Promotes that valid construction to the global minimum, missing still-smaller feasible ratios.
- Token 58907-60215 [wasted]: Long justification and algebra around the `2/3` branch after the key optimality error.
- Token 61774 [verification]: Small analog experiments confirm local consistency of the branch but not global optimality here.
- Token 63241 [missed opportunity]: Restricts to two construction families and still omits the decisive lower-ratio feasible branch.
- Token 63632 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{7}` (incorrect).
