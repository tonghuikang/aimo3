## Answer: wrong (11)

## Key moments
- Token 10052 [insight]: Correctly reframes the task as minimizing `lcm(a,b,c)` over triples summing to `N`.
- Token 16446 [insight]: Identifies a productive construction family based on divisor structure of `N-1`.
- Token 24990 [insight]: Sets up a systematic pair search using `(p,q)` and reduced denominator checks.
- Token 25967 [questionable statement]: Concludes feasibility is fully characterized by `v = D/gcd(pq,D)` dividing `N`.
- Token 33535 [breakthrough]: Finds `(p,q)=(2,6)` gives reduced ratio `3/5` and appears to satisfy that reduced condition for both offsets.
- Token 34630 [mistake]: Treats `(2,6)` as globally optimal without enforcing the stronger integrality constraints for the underlying divisors.
- Token 36845 [missed opportunity]: Rechecks only the `S>2/3` candidate set but still inside the same insufficient feasibility test.
- Token 37249-37628 [wasted]: Long modular-exponent implementation discussion after the decisive model error was already in place.
- Token 38095 [verification]: Performs final arithmetic consistency checks for `g=3/5` on both offsets, but within the wrong model.
- Token 38541 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{11}` (incorrect).
