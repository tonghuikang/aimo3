## Answer: correct (10477)

## Key moments
- Token 1424 [insight]: Uses the key objective correctly: minimize the lcm/scale ratio rather than directly manipulating huge `M`.
- Token 7644 [insight]: Reframes the task as minimizing `h(t)/t` over feasible `t` with `t | (M+c)`.
- Token 15259 [questionable statement]: Temporarily assumes feasible `t` should avoid factor `3`, which is not generally safe.
- Token 24693 [verification]: Confirms `t=47` is feasible for `c1` via modular reasoning and checks the witness triple.
- Token 25816 [mistake]: Briefly extrapolates that both offsets might share the same minimizing ratio `30/47`.
- Token 26498 [breakthrough]: Corrects course by computing the `c2` branch directly and identifying `t=97` with ratio `64/97`.
- Token 28340 [insight]: Explicitly reopens the search to include `t` with factor `3`, fixing the earlier restriction.
- Token 32722 [breakthrough]: Runs a systematic `t` scan and confirms minima `30/47` (first offset) and `64/97` (second offset).
- Token 33756 [verification]: Verifies floor exactness (`2025!` divisibility plus tiny `c/M` term) so `g(c)` equals those exact fractions.
- Token 35371-36159 [wasted]: Extra global ratio search beyond what was needed after the minimizing feasible `t` values were already found.
- Token 40068 [final answer]: Commits to remainder `10477` (correct).
