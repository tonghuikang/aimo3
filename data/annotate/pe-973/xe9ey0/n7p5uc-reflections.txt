## Answer: wrong (905611805)

## Key moments
- Token 797 [insight]: Correctly reframes scoring bitwise as expected time each XOR bit parity is `1`.
- Token 1808 [verification]: Monte Carlo reproduces anchor behavior (`n=2,4,10`) and confirms process interpretation.
- Token 5301 [verification]: Builds exact small-`n` linear-system DP, giving trustworthy ground-truth values for hypothesis checks.
- Token 13674-17563 [wasted]: Long sequence fitting and ratio heuristics without moving toward a scalable `n=10^4` method.
- Token 18661 [breakthrough]: Finds the exact expected-round count `2^{n-1}-1`, a real structural result.
- Token 25326 [breakthrough]: Proves LSB invariance (bit 0 fixed by `n mod 2`), another genuinely useful invariant.
- Token 26676-31282 [wasted]: Extended subset/hypercube speculation without a rigorous computable recurrence.
- Token 31282 [missed opportunity]: Nearly reaches the composition/subset sum formulation but does not operationalize it into an algorithm.
- Token 35021 [insight]: Recasts the target as XOR over run-length compositions of binary cut strings.
- Token 41126-45055 [wasted]: Returns to pattern-guessing on `N_{n,k}` statistics instead of committing to a validated recurrence implementation.
- Token 45459 [insight]: Derives a valid per-bit integer recurrence for `N_{n,k}` from first-cut decomposition.
- Token 52053 [missed opportunity]: Continues searching for closed forms instead of exploiting the already-derived recurrence path.
- Token 56220 [questionable statement]: Assumes a simple periodic plus/minus window update is sufficient for the signed convolution.
- Token 60748 [mistake]: Detects that this decomposition assumption is wrong; the derived update logic does not hold.
- Token 67570 [questionable statement]: Switches to asymptotic constant-ratio reasoning (`X(n) \approx c\,2^{n-1}`) as if it can support exact modular output.
- Token 76378 [questionable statement]: Proposes a generalized halving recursion with deterministic parity terms across levels.
- Token 76783 [mistake]: Quick test yields non-integer downstream quantity, directly invalidating that recursion.
- Token 77911 [questionable statement]: Moves to ad hoc large-`n` approximations (e.g., `2^{10001}/3`) without exact derivation.
- Token 80078 [verification]: Tests a candidate closed formula and gets clear mismatch against known exact values.
- Token 80239 [mistake]: Despite repeated failed checks, commits to the unsupported approximation `X(10^4) \approx 2^{10000}`.
- Token 80307 [final answer]: Computes `2^{10000} mod (10^9+7)` and outputs the guessed value `905611805`.
