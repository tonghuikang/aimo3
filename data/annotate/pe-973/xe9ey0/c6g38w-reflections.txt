## Answer: wrong (811223603)

## Key moments
- Token 1336 [insight]: Decomposes the score bitwise into parity counts per bit, setting up a per-bit expectation view.
- Token 6669 [verification]: Uses simulation/exact small-`n` values (`2,4,6,8,10,12`) to calibrate behavior against anchors.
- Token 10885 [verification]: Builds exact state-DP checks for `n=2,4,10`, confirming the modeled process matches given values.
- Token 11933 [questionable statement]: Treats growth-ratio observations as sufficient evidence that `X(n)` is essentially `~c·2^n`, steering toward extrapolation.
- Token 12338 [mistake]: Commits to asymptotic-factor reasoning without an exact formula, pushing the search away from a provably correct `n=10^4` method.
- Token 14173 [insight]: Derives an exact one-step update for XOR, `s' = s XOR a XOR b XOR (b+1) XOR ((a-1)%2)`.
- Token 18733 [breakthrough]: Shows the LSB update cancels (`delta_0=0`), correctly identifying bit-0 parity invariance.
- Token 21384 [breakthrough]: Finds and verifies the exact expected-round count `E[T]=2^{n-1}-1`.
- Token 22580 [missed opportunity]: After obtaining exact `E[T]` and bit decomposition, does not pivot to the composition/subset counting route that yields an exact algorithm.
- Token 28536-31236 [wasted]: Long Bernoulli/i.i.d. parity-random-walk modeling with assumptions that are not validated by the actual state-dependent process.
- Token 29909 [questionable statement]: Suggests treating bit-flip events as approximately independent with round-invariant probabilities `p_j`.
- Token 30975 [mistake]: Uses the unsupported i.i.d.-flip approximation to estimate bit-time contributions, yielding non-rigorous totals.
- Token 31236-33014 [wasted]: Continues deriving closed forms from the same unsupported independence model instead of returning to exact combinatorics.
- Token 33881-37460 [wasted]: Extensive potential-function search and algebraic detours without producing an exact recurrence.
- Token 37460-41549 [wasted]: Continues the same martingale/potential debugging thread without converging to a solvable `n=10^4` method.
- Token 41469 [verification]: Recomputes exact `2^{n+1}-X(n)` gaps on small `n` and confirms conjectured fits keep failing.
- Token 49003 [insight]: Simplifies even-`n` dynamics to `q_{new}=q XOR d` (with `d` from source half-size and target lowbit mask), a valid reformulation.
- Token 52122 [verification]: Empirically checks the derived `d` values and observes heavily skewed (not uniform) increment distribution, ruling out a simple uniform-XOR shortcut.
- Token 54412-61966 [wasted]: Repeated formula-guessing and subset analogies continue without a proof-backed path to exact modular output.
- Token 61966 [verification]: Extends exact/mod-DP values to larger `n` for hypothesis testing, but still no closed form or proven recurrence emerges.
- Token 67864 [questionable statement]: Floats a Fibonacci/`φ`-style asymptotic narrative and low-order recurrence guesses from limited data.
- Token 70311 [mistake]: Treats asymptotic trend as actionable for `n=10000` despite lacking the exact correction term required modulo `10^9+7`.
- Token 74193 [missed opportunity]: Even after concluding `X(n)` is near `2^{n+1}`, does not switch to an exact correction-term derivation and keeps extrapolating.
- Token 77529-83747 [wasted]: Further Berlekamp-Massey/recurrence fitting on too-few terms, eventually acknowledged as inconclusive.
- Token 86822 [questionable statement]: Frames `X(n)≈2^{n+1}` as near-usable while explicitly not computing the missing exact difference.
- Token 90280 [mistake]: Decides to output the asymptotic placeholder `X(10^4)≈2^{10001}` instead of an exact derivation.
- Token 90429 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{811223603}`, which is wrong.
