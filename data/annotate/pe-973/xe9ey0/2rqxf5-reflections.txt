## Answer: correct (427278142)

## Key moments
- Token 1539 [verification]: Monte Carlo checks against the provided anchors (`X(2)=2`, `X(4)=14`, `X(10)=1418`) to ensure the simulator/process interpretation is aligned before deriving formulas.
- Token 2258-8039 [wasted]: Early pattern-guessing and brute-force state analysis consume many tokens without producing a scalable formula.
- Token 9071 [insight]: Identifies and verifies the exact expected-rounds formula `T(n)=2^{n-1}-1`, which later supports composition counting sanity checks.
- Token 15532 [missed opportunity]: Continues asymptotic/closed-form guessing from observed growth instead of exploiting the structural combinatorics already surfacing.
- Token 23293 [missed opportunity]: Attempts to force per-bit count sequences into simple recurrences from small-`n` data, extending a weak direction.
- Token 29953-36467 [wasted]: Additional sequence fitting and speculative mappings before the subset/composition model is finally formalized.
- Token 36467 [insight]: Introduces the key hypothesis that the expectation can be rewritten as a sum over subset/cut configurations (composition view).
- Token 39014 [missed opportunity]: Backs away from the subset representation after observing repeated states in raw simulations, delaying formalization of the composition reduction.
- Token 43370 [breakthrough]: Commits to the core reduction `X(n)=S(n)-(n mod 2)` with `S(n)` as the xor-sum over all compositions, converting the stochastic problem to combinatorics.
- Token 49017 [insight]: Sets up the signed generating-function recurrence `a_n=\sum s_k a_{n-k}` for per-bit odd/even composition counts.
- Token 53575 [questionable statement]: Claims a simplified denominator/recurrence form for `a_n` without fully resolving the indexing offset in the bit-sign pattern.
- Token 57357 [mistake]: Small-`n` validation fails, showing the derived recurrence is incorrect despite the algebraic confidence.
- Token 60156 [insight]: Re-derives the sign sequence from exact residue classes of `k mod 2^{b+1}`, identifying the earlier offset error.
- Token 69277 [breakthrough]: Obtains the corrected rational form `G_b(x)=(x^m+1)/(2x^m-\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}x^i+1)` and corresponding linear-time-per-bit recurrence.
- Token 72316 [verification]: Verifies the corrected formula matches exact DP values for many small `n` (through `n=16`).
- Token 73248 [verification]: Independent brute-force subset check confirms `sum_subsets = X(n) + (n mod 2)` on small instances.
- Token 74685 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{427278142}`.
