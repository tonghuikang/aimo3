## Answer: correct (427278142)

## Key moments
- Token 1313 [insight]: Frames the objective bitwise (`X(n)=\sum_k 2^k \cdot E[\#\text{rounds with bit-}k\text{ parity}=1]`), which sets up later per-bit counting.
- Token 5377 [verification]: Monte Carlo checks confirm the simulator matches anchor values and gives reliable small-`n` behavior before symbolic work.
- Token 5979 [insight]: Computes exact small-`n` values via DP, giving concrete targets for later recurrence validation.
- Token 15398-17563 [wasted]: Extended asymptotic and sequence-guessing attempts (ratios/OEIS-style speculation) without structural progress.
- Token 18661 [insight]: Finds the exact expected-round count `2^{n-1}-1`, a major structural clue tied to subset/composition counting.
- Token 25326 [insight]: Proves LSB parity invariance (bit 0 fixed by `n mod 2`), simplifying per-bit analysis.
- Token 26676-30559 [wasted]: Long speculative mapping of rounds to subset traversals and hypercube-like interpretations before formalizing a usable formula.
- Token 31282 [breakthrough]: Commits to the combinatorial reduction: expected score equals a sum over cut-subset/composition XOR values.
- Token 32191 [insight]: Corrects the odd-`n` offset explicitly as `X(n)=\sum_{S\subseteq[n-1]} f(S) - (n\bmod 2)`.
- Token 35021 [insight]: Recasts the problem as XOR of run-length blocks over binary strings, enabling recurrence design.
- Token 41126-45055 [wasted]: Repeated pattern fitting on `N_{n,k}` ratios/differences and heuristic formulas delays direct recurrence construction.
- Token 45459 [breakthrough]: Derives the integer DP recurrence for per-bit counts `N_{n,k}` from first-cut decomposition.
- Token 52053 [missed opportunity]: Continues searching for a closed form despite already having a computable recurrence path.
- Token 56220 [questionable statement]: Assumes a simple half-window sign partition for convolution weights, ignoring the 1-index phase offset in `c_i`.
- Token 61213 [mistake]: Small-`n` checks show the fast implementation overcounts (`X(4)`/`X(6)` mismatches), confirming the window/sign update is wrong.
- Token 66987 [insight]: Identifies the root cause: coefficient pattern is shifted because `bit_k(i)` is evaluated on 1-indexed distances.
- Token 72755 [breakthrough]: Establishes corrected `O(1)` window formula (range-sum plus extra boundary term and `S[n-M]` carry), yielding the right fast DP.
- Token 73883 [verification]: Fast method matches trusted DP values on small test cases.
- Token 74482 [verification]: Additional fast-vs-brute comparison across multiple even `n` confirms implementation stability.
- Token 74798 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{427278142}`.
