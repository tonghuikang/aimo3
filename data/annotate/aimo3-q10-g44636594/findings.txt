# Findings: aimo3-q10-g44636594

## Correct answer
- \(g(44636594)=\frac{110}{167}\), so \(p=110\), \(q=167\), and
- \((p+q) \bmod 99991 = 277\).

## Correct approach
- Rewrite
  - \(f(n)=\min\{\operatorname{lcm}(a,b,c): a,b,c\text{ distinct positive integers},\ a+b+c=n\}\).
- Use a two-parameter divisor form for the optimal constructions:
  - choose divisors \(N,\ N/p,\ N/q\) with distinct \(p,q>1\), giving
  - \(n = N\left(1+\frac1p+\frac1q\right)=N\frac{pq+p+q}{pq}\), hence
  - \(N = n\cdot \frac{pq}{pq+p+q}\).
- Let \(D=pq+p+q\). For this problem (\(n=M+c\), \(M=3^{2025!}\), \(c=44636594\)), feasible \(D\) are constrained by divisibility against \(n\), which reduces to divisibility against \(c+1\) for the relevant cases.
- The best feasible ratio is obtained at \((p,q)=(2,55)\):
  - \(D=167\),
  - \(\frac{pq}{D}=\frac{110}{167}\),
  - so \(f(M+c)=\frac{110}{167}(M+c)\).
- Then
  - \(\frac{2025!\,f(M+c)}{M}=\frac{2025!\cdot110}{167}\left(1+\frac{c}{M}\right)\),
  - with \(\frac{c}{M}\) tiny and \(167\mid 2025!\), so the floor is exactly \(\frac{2025!\cdot110}{167}\),
  - hence \(g(c)=\frac{110}{167}\).

## Wrong approaches and why they fail
- Restricting to the \((1,b,N)\) family only (equivalently using only \(k-1\) divisor logic):
  - gives \(f\)-ratio \(16/17\), leading to \(g=16/17\) and answer \(33\),
  - fails because it ignores better constructions with two nontrivial proper divisors (e.g. the \((2,55)\) branch).
- Prematurely choosing the \(103\)-based candidate:
  - yields \(g=68/103\) and answer \(171\),
  - fails because \(167\)-based construction gives strictly smaller ratio \(110/167<68/103\).
- Using only integrality of \(N = n\cdot pq/(pq+p+q)\) without enforcing divisor compatibility (\(p\mid N\), \(q\mid N\)):
  - can suggest invalid lower ratios such as \(3/5\),
  - fails because those pairs do not correspond to actual divisors \(N/p, N/q\) of the constructed \(N\).
