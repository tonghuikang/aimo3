## Answer: correct (277)

## Key moments
- Token 252 [insight]: Reframes the task as choosing three distinct integers summing to \(n\) and minimizing their common-multiple cost.
- Token 641 [breakthrough]: Formalizes \(f(n)=\min \operatorname{lcm}(a,b,c)\) over distinct \(a+b+c=n\).
- Token 741 [questionable statement]: Suggests that using \(1\) as one divisor is likely optimal without proving global optimality.
- Token 1096 [mistake]: Collapses the search to \(\min \operatorname{lcm}(a,n-1-a)\), incorrectly excluding better three-nontrivial-divisor patterns.
- Token 2420 [insight]: Notices that triples with shared scaling could lower the LCM/sum ratio beyond the \((1,\cdot,\cdot)\) family.
- Token 2958 [breakthrough]: Finds the \((d,2d,4d)\) construction with ratio \(4/7\), breaking the earlier restricted model.
- Token 3561 [questionable statement]: Proposes \(\operatorname{lcm}(d,2d,3d)=3d\), which is arithmetically suspect.
- Token 3664 [mistake]: Uses the wrong LCM value for \((d,2d,3d)\); this is later corrected to \(6d\).
- Token 7769 [insight]: Starts a direct search over small primitive triples to locate the true best base ratio.
- Token 8235 [breakthrough]: Identifies \((2,3,6)\) with ratio \(6/11\) as the best available primitive benchmark.
- Token 15252-17006 [wasted]: Long brute-force modular sweep over many small \(s\) values before tightening to the relevant divisor structure.
- Token 16038 [verification]: Confirms \(N\not\equiv0\pmod{11}\), so the \(6/11\) optimum is unavailable.
- Token 18475 [insight]: Uses \(c+1\) to characterize actionable small divisors of \(N\) (excluding the \(p=3\) caveat).
- Token 20316 [questionable statement]: Prematurely infers the global minimum from the smallest valid divisor \(s=103\).
- Token 20774 [mistake]: Commits to \(r_{\min}=68/103\) before checking other divisor classes (notably \(167\)).
- Token 29326 [insight]: Re-centers on minimizing over all primitive-sum divisors \(s_0\mid N\), not just the smallest divisor.
- Token 30102 [breakthrough]: Correctly compares candidates and selects \(110/167\) via the \(s_0=167\) construction.
- Token 34909 [verification]: Validates the floor step as integer plus tiny \(\varepsilon<1\), fixing \(g(c)=110/167\).
- Token 35175 [final answer]: Outputs \(277\), matching the correct result.
