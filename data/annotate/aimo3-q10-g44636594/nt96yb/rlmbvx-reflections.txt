## Answer: correct (277)

## Key moments
- Token 95 [questionable statement]: Interprets the prompt as if numbers must have exactly three divisors, narrowing the search space incorrectly.
- Token 565 [mistake]: Pushes the exact-three-divisors interpretation to a prime-square-style dead end.
- Token 681 [insight]: Corrects the reading to “at least three divisors with required sum,” restoring the intended optimization problem.
- Token 747 [breakthrough]: Rewrites \(f(n)\) as a minimum-LCM-over-triples formulation.
- Token 6790 [insight]: Connects divisibility checks to \(c+1\), setting up concrete candidate factors of \(N\).
- Token 7261 [breakthrough]: Extracts the key usable small divisors \(5,103,167,173\) for the ratio search.
- Token 15115 [verification]: Rechecks the global \(6/11\) primitive optimum and uses divisibility constraints to test attainability.
- Token 24940 [questionable statement]: Leans on a heuristic next-ratio progression (e.g., \(10/17\)) before fully enumerating allowed divisor-sum structures.
- Token 25072 [insight]: Pivots to the correct criterion: minimize ratio only over sums \(U\) that actually divide \(N\).
- Token 27622 [mistake]: Prematurely locks in the \(68/103\) route before comparing stronger available divisor candidates.
- Token 33103-33217 [wasted]: Extra brute-force probing after the decisive candidate set is already small.
- Token 40269 [breakthrough]: Compares \(68/103\), \(110/167\), and \(114/173\), correctly selecting \(110/167\).
- Token 42587 [verification]: Confirms floor behavior with tiny positive \(\varepsilon\), preserving \(g(c)=110/167\).
- Token 50482 [verification]: Final consistency pass reiterates the same reduced fraction.
- Token 50642 [final answer]: Commits to \(277\), which is correct.
