## Answer: correct (88341)

## Key moments
- Token 1359 [insight]: Reframes the task as counting residue frequencies with a per-length DP over modulo `p` states.
- Token 2144 [questionable statement]: Starts leaning on a near-uniform residue assumption (`floor/ceil` style reasoning) instead of an exact counting argument.
- Token 2541 [mistake]: Treats the divisible-count as essentially `floor(N_total/p)` or `ceil(N_total/p)`, which is not valid for this constrained palindrome set.
- Token 3241-6128 [wasted]: Long Fourier/equidistribution speculation does not produce a computable path to the exact count.
- Token 7784-9172 [wasted]: Continues abstract character-sum analysis without reducing uncertainty about the exact residue-0 count.
- Token 9280-14980 [wasted]: Additional planning detours (meet-in-the-middle and optimization discussion) before committing to direct computation.
- Token 15369 [insight]: Pivots to a concrete vectorized numpy DP with cyclic shifts and modular accumulation.
- Token 16733 [verification]: Checks the DP on `p=109` and confirms the known small-case behavior.
- Token 18834 [breakthrough]: Executes the full computation for `p=10,000,019` and obtains `88341 (mod 99991)`.
- Token 24663 [verification]: Re-runs with modulus `p*99991` to recover exact count `2,000,008,332`, confirming the same modulo result.
- Token 26261 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{88341}`; final answer is correct.
