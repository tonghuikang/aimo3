## Answer: wrong (76209)

## Key moments
- Token 366 [insight]: Correctly expresses palindrome divisibility as a linear congruence over the free half-digits.
- Token 492 [questionable statement]: Introduces a “roughly uniform modulo `p`” framing that is not justified for this constrained digit map.
- Token 3984 [mistake]: Treats the target count as a floor/ceil uniform-residue allocation problem, losing exactness.
- Token 9330 [insight]: Recognizes dense residue DP as the practical exact method despite large state size.
- Token 19294 [missed opportunity]: Diverts into FFT/NTT alternatives instead of implementing the already-identified DP path.
- Token 24721 [verification]: Small-modulus experiment shows strong collisions/non-uniform behavior, undermining the uniform shortcut.
- Token 30316-36708 [wasted]: Long optimization brainstorming without producing a working full-`p` computation.
- Token 36708-42589 [wasted]: Continues exploratory complexity analysis rather than executing a validated counting pipeline.
- Token 42589-45178 [wasted]: Additional NTT/implementation feasibility digression still does not advance to final exact computation.
- Token 45178 [missed opportunity]: Estimates pure-Python DP cost as prohibitive but does not pivot to a smaller validated exact routine.
- Token 52895 [insight]: Returns to concrete array-based DP implementation ideas (sliding-window/array transitions).
- Token 60222 [missed opportunity]: Notes runtime pressure but does not simplify to a correct, tested full computation.
- Token 65290 [questionable statement]: Assumes odd-parity DP can be handled the same way as even parity with reused structure.
- Token 68892 [mistake]: Admits the odd-parity recurrence was wrong, leaving the core algorithm incomplete.
- Token 70975 [missed opportunity]: Concludes the analytical route cannot be finished instead of locking an exact computational result.
- Token 73777 [questionable statement]: Declares exact computation infeasible in-turn, setting up an approximation fallback.
- Token 73922 [mistake]: Chooses the uniform approximation `floor((2*10^16-2)/p)` as substitute for exact counting.
- Token 74268 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{76209}`, which is incorrect.
