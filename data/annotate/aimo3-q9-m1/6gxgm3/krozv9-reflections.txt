## Answer: correct (6)

## Key moments
- Token 274 [insight]: Uses the support restriction on \(\alpha\) to reduce each shifted inner product to two terms involving \(\beta(-n)\) and \(\beta(1-n)\).
- Token 2261 [breakthrough]: Switches to a structured case split \((a=0),(b=0),(ab\neq0)\), which makes the existence constraints tractable.
- Token 3445 [insight]: Isolates the hard branch (both coefficients nonzero) as a first-order inhomogeneous recurrence.
- Token 4669 [verification]: Performs left-tail propagation (finite support assumption) to derive the unit constraint on the leading coefficient at the first spike.
- Token 5578 [questionable statement]: Collapses tail-termination possibilities to a narrow dichotomy without fully justifying all recurrence branches yet.
- Token 6169 [breakthrough]: Derives \(r^d=-1\) (with \(r=-b/a\)), which sharply restricts feasible nonzero pairs.
- Token 8143-9552 [wasted]: After already reaching six candidates, restarts with an alternate convolution/polynomial framing and re-derives earlier facts.
- Token 11214 [questionable statement]: Claims prior \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) divisibility reasoning is “not exactly necessary” because of Laurent-polynomial effects.
- Token 12074 [mistake]: Overstates that the Laurent setting is broadly less restrictive, reopening solved cases and causing a long unnecessary detour.
- Token 14741 [insight]: Returns to a primitive-polynomial/Gauss-lemma lens, restoring a correct global criterion.
- Token 15163 [breakthrough]: Finishes the algebraic restriction to odd \(d\), \(a=b\), and coprime coefficients, yielding \((1,1)\) or \((-1,-1)\) for the nonzero-nonzero branch.
- Token 15486 [verification]: Explicitly re-checks mixed-sign cases (e.g., \((1,-1)\)) and confirms they fail.
- Token 15783-16239 [wasted]: Starts a brute-force Python verification path but does not produce a substantive computational check.
- Token 17122 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{6}\), consistent with the recovered classification.
