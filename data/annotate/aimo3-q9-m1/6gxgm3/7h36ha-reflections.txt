## Answer: correct (6)

## Key moments
- Token 659 [insight]: Parameterizes \(\alpha\) by \((a,b)=(\alpha(0),\alpha(1))\), reducing the search to integer pairs.
- Token 1215 [breakthrough]: Introduces \(\gamma(n)=\beta(-n)\) and rewrites the condition as \(a\gamma(n)+b\gamma(n-1)=f(n)\) with two-point forcing.
- Token 3409 [insight]: Notes that one-point support for \(\gamma\) immediately yields viable same-sign unit pairs \((1,1)\), \((-1,-1)\).
- Token 6404 [questionable statement]: Suggests the two spikes must be adjacent, based on an incomplete cancellation argument.
- Token 6645 [mistake]: Concludes adjacency is the only arrangement, which is later contradicted by valid odd-distance constructions.
- Token 7038 [breakthrough]: Reopens the full recurrence analysis, correcting the overrestriction and allowing non-adjacent odd distances.
- Token 7115-10461 [wasted]: Extended recurrence manipulations and repeated case restarts largely re-derive constraints already implicit in earlier structure.
- Token 10462 [insight]: Extracts a clean necessary condition \(|a|=1\) from left-boundary propagation.
- Token 13732 [breakthrough]: Derives \(a=b\) and odd \((l-k)\) in the nonzero-nonzero branch, giving precisely \((1,1)\) and \((-1,-1)\).
- Token 15783 [verification]: Uses telescoping/discrete-derivative behavior to reject mixed-sign unit pairs (e.g., \((1,-1)\)).
- Token 17253 [questionable statement]: Reopens non-unit possibilities (e.g., \(a=2\)) despite already having strong unit constraints.
- Token 18368 [verification]: Reasserts extremal-support forcing at the second spike, recovering \(b=\pm1\) and excluding those reopened non-unit branches.
- Token 19970 [breakthrough]: Consolidates a rigorous necessary-condition proof from extremal indices, unifying earlier scattered arguments.
- Token 21555 [verification]: Final direct check shows \((1,-1)\) and \((-1,1)\) fail, completing exclusion of mixed-sign cases.
- Token 22323 [breakthrough]: Final admissible set is stabilized as \((\pm1,0),(0,\pm1),(1,1),(-1,-1)\).
- Token 23115 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{6}\).
