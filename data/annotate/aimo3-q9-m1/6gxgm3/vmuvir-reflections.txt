## Answer: correct (6)

## Key moments
- Token 804 [insight]: Reduces the shifted dot product to two terms, \(a_0\beta(-n)+a_1\beta(1-n)\), using support of \(\alpha\subseteq\{0,1\}\).
- Token 1510 [breakthrough]: Rewrites the condition as the recurrence \(a_0\beta(m)+a_1\beta(m+1)=h(m)\), which is the right structural form for classification.
- Token 2164 [questionable statement]: Suggests divisibility-by-\(a_1\) from the forward form as if it globally constrains all cases, without yet separating boundary/zero-coefficient branches.
- Token 2785 [missed opportunity]: Could switch to a polynomial/Laurent divisibility view earlier instead of extending ad-hoc tail-propagation arguments.
- Token 3446-6113 [wasted]: Long exploratory recurrence/boundary discussion repeats similar logic before introducing a cleaner algebraic representation.
- Token 5776 [mistake]: Prematurely concludes both coefficients must be \(\pm1\) in all cases before properly resolving one-zero-coefficient families.
- Token 6466 [insight]: Reframes the map as an image/divisibility problem in \(\mathbb{Z}[x,x^{-1}]\).
- Token 7597 [breakthrough]: Derives \(xF(x)=(a_0x+a_1)B(x)\), enabling direct divisibility tests against a two-spike target polynomial.
- Token 8115 [verification]: Uses \((a_0x+a_1)\mid(x^d+1)\) with rational-root/content checks to eliminate non-unit and mixed nonzero coefficient cases.
- Token 12324 [questionable statement]: Briefly states there are "four possibilities" while still carrying monomial edge cases; the count statement is inconsistent at that point.
- Token 14109 [breakthrough]: Corrects enumeration to six valid \(\alpha\) types and supplies explicit \(\beta\) constructions.
- Token 15362-16039 [verification]: Independently tests \((1,-1)\) and \((-1,1)\) via difference/telescoping behavior to confirm finite-support failure.
- Token 17058 [final answer]: Commits to \(\boxed{6}\), matching the corrected classification.
