## Answer: correct (3679796)

## Key moments
- Token 422 [insight]: Switches to de Bruijn indices, correctly framing alpha-equivalence as a binding-structure counting problem.
- Token 1215 [verification]: Confirms the symbol-cost model (variable 1, abstraction 5 + body, application 2 + left + right) against the sample syntax.
- Token 2622 [breakthrough]: Writes the core depth-indexed recurrence `T(d,s)` with disjoint variable/abstraction/application cases.
- Token 12099 [verification]: Implements small-`n` DP checks to validate the recurrence against provided checkpoints before scaling.
- Token 12843 [missed opportunity]: Assumes complexity will be prohibitive and spends significant time on alternative formulations before first benchmarking the direct method.
- Token 15386 [questionable statement]: Hypothesizes `F_d = d*X(z) + Y(z)` (linear in `d`) without sufficient justification.
- Token 15439 [mistake]: Proceeds with recurrence algebra under that linear ansatz, which is incompatible with the quadratic `F_d^2` term in general.
- Token 15739 [verification]: Uses the `d^2` contradiction (`X^2 = 0`) to reject the flawed ansatz and return to a valid DP path.
- Token 16344-17875 [wasted]: Long optimization/FFT detour that does not change the final method.
- Token 17875 [insight]: Identifies an incremental-convolution update scheme that makes the direct O(`D*n^2`) implementation practical enough to try.
- Token 18180 [breakthrough]: Runs the full `n=2000` direct computation path and confirms it is feasible in this environment.
- Token 19875 [verification]: Re-checks recurrence correctness by matching all given sample values (`Lambda(6), Lambda(9), Lambda(15), Lambda(35)`) before finalizing.
- Token 20008 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{3679796}`; this final answer is correct.
