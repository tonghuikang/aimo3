## Answer: correct (18029)

## Key moments
- Token 319 [insight]: Correctly frames the task as understanding \(f(M+c)\) asymptotically/exactly rather than attempting direct computation with gigantic \(M\).
- Token 1474 [insight]: Recasts \(f(n)\) as a minimum-LCM problem over triples summing to \(n\), which is a productive structural viewpoint.
- Token 3312 [questionable statement]: Pushes a broad ratio-minimization heuristic (via \(L/S\)) without enforcing all integrality/divisor constraints needed for exact minimization.
- Token 4759 [breakthrough]: Identifies the tight \(6/11\) lower-bound pattern from \((1,1/2,1/3)\)-type structure, giving the right optimization intuition baseline.
- Token 8247 [verification]: Correctly computes \(M\bmod 11\) and checks when the \(6/11\)-extremal case is feasible for the given offsets.
- Token 12550 [mistake]: Overcommits to a near-\(\lceil 6n/11\rceil\) template before proving existence of matching divisor triples for these specific \(n\).
- Token 17290 [questionable statement]: Transitional assumption that smallest valid divisors should follow simple small-prime behavior; this is not sufficient to prove minimality.
- Token 24316-31239 [wasted]: Long algebraic detour trying to force adjusted near-extremal constructions (e.g., \(6K\)-style forms) instead of directly optimizing admissible \(D=ab+a+b\) candidates.
- Token 31488 [breakthrough]: Switches to the correct exact search criterion: enumerate admissible divisors \(D\mid n\), solve \(D=ab+a+b\), and minimize \(ab/D\).
- Token 31528 [verification]: Systematic ratio checks confirm best choices \(D=47\Rightarrow 30/47\) for \(n_1\) and \(D=167\Rightarrow 110/167\) for \(n_2\).
- Token 32354 [verification]: Computes \(g(c_1)+g(c_2)=30/47+110/167=10180/7849\) and confirms reduction.
- Token 38136 [final answer]: Commits to final value \(18029\), which is correct.
