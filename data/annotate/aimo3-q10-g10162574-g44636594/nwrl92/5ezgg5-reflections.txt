## Answer: correct (18029)

## Key moments
- Token 159 [insight]: Correctly recognizes that each \(g(c)\) is a floor-scaled rational and that reduction/GCD will matter for final \(p/q\).
- Token 1036-44015 [wasted]: Long exploratory loop (small-\(n\) brute force, prime-factor checks, and special-case algebra) before switching to the complete \(N+N/u+N/v\) formulation.
- Token 8314 [questionable statement]: Leans on the restricted \(1+d+N\) family (e.g., "minimal \(N\) is \(n-3\) if ..."), which is not the full optimization space.
- Token 12063 [verification]: Uses modular properties of \(M=3^{2025!}\) to reason about divisibility conditions, but still inside the restricted framework.
- Token 18579 [mistake]: Commits to the wrong parameterization via smallest odd prime factors (\(p_1=5081287, p_2=17\)) as if it determined \(f(n)\), which would overestimate \(f(M+c)\).
- Token 24213 [insight]: Derives the sharper lower-bound geometry (\(N\ge 6n/11\)), hinting that a much smaller \(N\) than the prime-factor route is possible.
- Token 33342 [questionable statement]: Overgeneralizes a divisor-of-\(n-1\) template into a supposed general formula for \(f(n)\), even after small-\(n\) counterexamples appear.
- Token 34695 [verification]: Brute-force cross-checks expose many mismatches, confirming the current formula is unreliable.
- Token 37709 [insight]: Reframes the search with \(N,\,N/u,\,N/v\) and ratio optimization \(N=n\cdot uv/(uv+u+v)\), which opens the correct route.
- Token 43035 [verification]: Finds concrete feasible ratio candidates (e.g., \((u,v)=(3,7)\)) and starts ranking them by achievable \(N/n\).
- Token 48033 [breakthrough]: Moves to the correct general form \(N=n\cdot uv/(uv+u+v)\) with exact integrality/divisibility constraints.
- Token 51190 [verification]: First successful constrained search returns best ratios \((30/47)\) and \((110/167)\), matching the correct structure.
- Token 52023 [breakthrough]: Commits to \(f(n_1)=(30/47)n_1\) and \(f(n_2)=(110/167)n_2\), replacing the earlier incorrect prime-factor model.
- Token 53321 [verification]: Re-runs the full search with stronger bounds/constraints and confirms the same optimal pairs.
- Token 54558 [verification]: Extends the search window (larger \(u,v\)) to check no better pair was missed.
- Token 55440 [final answer]: Outputs \(\boxed{18029}\), which is correct.
