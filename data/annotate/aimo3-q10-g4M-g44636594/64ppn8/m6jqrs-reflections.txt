## Answer: wrong (15300)

## Key moments
- Token 406-2150 [mistake]: Early setup overcommits to triples of the form \((1,a,N)\), which is too restrictive and leads to a distorted objective.
- Token 1245-5743 [wasted]: A long derivation builds casework on that restricted model, including fragile special-case handling, before the trace shifts to a stronger formulation.
- Token 40035 [breakthrough]: Correctly re-derives \(f(n)=\min_{K\mid n}(n/K)\,h(K)\), bringing the analysis back to the right divisor-sum optimization framework.
- Token 40621 [breakthrough]: Uses the corrected framework to get \(f(5M)=\frac{10}{3}M\), the right first-term structure.
- Token 41774 [breakthrough]: Finds the right second-term ratio \(\frac{110}{167}\) for \(M+44636594\), which supports the correct total \(2501\).
- Token 46006 [mistake]: Late regression replaces the first term with \(5-\frac{1}{2025!}\), effectively reverting to the earlier faulty model and breaking the final arithmetic.
- Token 57190 [verification]: Performs modular checks thoroughly, but only for the regressed expression, so the verification is internally consistent yet globally wrong.
- Token 57657 [final answer]: Finalizes \(\boxed{15300}\), which is incorrect.
