## Answer: correct (2501)

## Key moments
- Token 165 [missed opportunity]: Starts with speculation about whether \(f(n)\approx n\), which delays committing to a structural optimization view.
- Token 377 [breakthrough]: Reframes the task as \(f(n)=\min \operatorname{lcm}(a,b,c)\) over distinct \(a+b+c=n\), which is the core reduction.
- Token 2975-14442 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch brute-forcing small cases and searching global ratio patterns before specializing to divisors of the actual target values.
- Token 14975 [breakthrough]: Applies divisibility constraints to \(n_1=5M\) and rules out the \(6/11\) regime, narrowing to feasible divisor-sum templates.
- Token 26027 [breakthrough]: Concludes \(f(5M)=\frac{10}{3}M\), giving \(g(4M)=\frac{10}{3}\).
- Token 32641 [breakthrough]: Identifies the optimal second-case ratio \(\frac{110}{167}\), yielding \(g(44636594)=\frac{110}{167}\).
- Token 32746 [verification]: Explicitly checks pitfalls (no better divisor family for \(5M\), tiny epsilon term for floor, and consistency of the \(167\)-based construction).
- Token 33013 [final answer]: Commits to \(\frac{2000}{501}\Rightarrow p+q=2501\), matching the expected correct result.
