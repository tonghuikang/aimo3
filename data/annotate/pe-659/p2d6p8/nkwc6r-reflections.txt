## Answer: correct (238518915714422000)

## Key moments
- Token 668 [insight]: Uses subtraction of consecutive terms to obtain the key shared-divisor condition `p | (2n+1)`.
- Token 1588 [breakthrough]: Eliminates `n` via congruences and derives `4k^2 ≡ -1 (mod p)`, i.e. shared primes must divide `4k^2+1`.
- Token 1933 [insight]: States the bidirectional characterization of candidate primes via the constructed `n ≡ (p-1)/2 (mod p)`.
- Token 2463 [breakthrough]: Finalizes the reduction `P(k) =` largest prime factor of `4k^2+1`.
- Token 4496-5476 [wasted]: Extended inclusion-exclusion/smooth-number reformulations that are not used in the final computation path.
- Token 4721 [missed opportunity]: Already recognizes exact computation is required, but does not commit immediately to the direct sieve-factorization implementation.
- Token 6550 [questionable statement]: Suggests there may be a simple exponent shortcut for `sqrt(-1) mod p` for all `p ≡ 1 (mod 4)` without establishing correctness.
- Token 8119 [mistake]: Proposes `pow(-1, (p-1)//4, p)` as a direct `sqrt(-1)` formula; quick check (e.g., `p=5`) shows it is incorrect.
- Token 8605 [insight]: Explicitly accepts that a general modular square-root method is needed.
- Token 9560 [breakthrough]: Locks in the correct implementation strategy: Tonelli-Shanks per valid prime, progression updates for residues, divide-out remainder, and `max(max_factor, rem)`.
- Token 11830 [verification]: Confirms algorithm against brute-force totals on small cases (`N=100`, `N=1000`), matching exactly.
- Token 13373 [verification]: Runs the full `N=10,000,000` computation and obtains the large total before modulus extraction.
- Token 13674 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{238518915714422000}`.
