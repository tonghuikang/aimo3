## Problem Summary
`G(n)` counts ordered triples of triangular numbers `(T_a, T_b, T_c)` with sum `n`.
Target: `G(17526 * 10^9) mod 99991`.

## Correct Answer
`30738`

## Correct Approach
1. Use `T_k = k(k+1)/2` and set `u = 2k+1` (odd positive). Then
   `u^2 + v^2 + w^2 = M`, where `M = 8n + 3`.
2. Because `M ≡ 3 (mod 8)`, every integer solution of `x^2+y^2+z^2=M` has all coordinates odd, so
   `G(n) = r_3(M)/8`.
3. Use the three-squares class-number identity in the Hurwitz normalization used here:
   `r_3(m) = 12 * H(-4m)`.
4. For `M = 3^8 * 13 * 3527 * 466073`, set
   `D = -4M = f^2 * D0` with `f = 162` and
   `D0 = -13 * 3527 * 466073 = -21369913123` (fundamental discriminant).
5. Expand Hurwitz class number via order class numbers:
   `H(D) = (1/2) * sum_{t|f} h(D0 * t^2)` (all relevant `w=2` here), and
   `h(D0 * t^2) = h(D0) * t * prod_{p|t}(1 - chi(p)/p)`.
   With `chi(2) = chi(3) = -1`, the divisor-factor sum is `644`.
6. Therefore `G(n) = 483 * h(D0)`.
7. Compute `h(D0) = 23664` (reduced binary quadratic forms).
8. Final value:
   `G = 483 * 23664 = 11429712`, so
   `G mod 99991 = 30738`.

## Wrong Approaches
### Wrong Branch A (trace `1ktnxx`, answer `17447`)
- Uses the wrong normalization branch `r_3(n)=24*H(-n)` instead of the needed `-4n` branch for this setup.
- This sets discriminant as `D=-M` (not `-4M`), giving conductor `f=81` instead of `162`.
- The Hurwitz/order sum then uses only divisors of `81`, producing factor `161` instead of `644`.
- That yields `G = (483/2) * h(D0)` (factor-of-2 error), leading to wrong modulo result `17447`.

### Wrong Branch B (trace `0ku9wa`, answer `0` guessed)
- Repeatedly alternates among incompatible formulas (`24H(-n)`, divisor-sum variants, mixed `H` normalizations) without fixing one consistent convention.
- Never stabilizes the discriminant/conductor setup and keeps generating contradictory checks.
- Ends by guessing a value (`0`) without a validated derivation.

## Critical Decision Points
1. Lock the correct three-squares normalization before any conductor arithmetic.
2. Use `D=-4M` (not `-M`) when expanding Hurwitz class numbers for this route.
3. Keep class-number conventions consistent (`H`, primitive/order class numbers, and unit factors).
4. Compute the divisor-factor sum over the correct conductor divisors (`f=162`).
5. Finish with an exact `h(D0)` computation (e.g., reduced-form enumeration), then reduce modulo `99991`.
