## Answer: wrong (17447)

## Key moments
- Token 335 [insight]: Correctly transforms the triangular-number equation into counting ordered odd-square representations of `N = 8n+3`.
- Token 3275 [breakthrough]: Uses `N \equiv 3 \pmod 8` to justify that all square terms are odd and links `G(n)` to `r_3(N)/8`.
- Token 8647 [questionable statement]: Introduces `r_3(n)=24H(-n)` as the working formula without resolving the `-n` vs `-4n` discriminant choice.
- Token 11428 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly raises the `-N` vs `-4N` ambiguity but does not settle it with a decisive check.
- Token 11869 [mistake]: Commits to the wrong identity branch (`r_3(N)=24H(-N)`), which shifts all downstream conductor arithmetic.
- Token 18882 [questionable statement]: Starts the discriminant decomposition from `D=-N` and treats only the `3^8` square factor as conductor data.
- Token 19494 [mistake]: Fixes conductor as `f=81` (instead of `f=162` under the correct `D=-4N` setup).
- Token 19959 [questionable statement]: Enumerates only divisors of `81`, excluding the missing factor-2 divisor family from the correct conductor.
- Token 21426 [mistake]: Computes the wrong Hurwitz multiplier `161`, propagating `H=(161/2)h0`.
- Token 21614 [missed opportunity]: Converts that into `G=(483/2)h0`, locking in the factor-of-2 error.
- Token 28873-35021 [wasted]: Long re-derivation of class-number identities and constants without revisiting the already-critical discriminant choice.
- Token 35021-39810 [wasted]: Continues auxiliary reduction/enumeration work while the conductor error remains uncorrected.
- Token 44237 [missed opportunity]: Reasserts the wrong global formula path and proceeds to compute `h(D0)` instead of revalidating the discriminant normalization.
- Token 50023-55992 [wasted]: Implements and tunes class-number computations under the wrong branch, yielding precise but misaligned intermediate results.
- Token 55992 [missed opportunity]: Notes inconsistencies in sanity checks but does not trace them back to the `-4N` requirement.
- Token 62067-70025 [wasted]: Extensive test-case and algebra loops continue to preserve the same upstream factorization error.
- Token 70025 [missed opportunity]: Small-case comparisons reveal formula instability, but the trace still does not reset the discriminant/conductor setup.
- Token 74256 [missed opportunity]: Acknowledges prior derivation mismatch on sample cases yet still avoids correcting the original `-N` assumption.
- Token 74978 [breakthrough]: Correctly identifies that primitive (not total) class numbers are needed for non-fundamental discriminants.
- Token 79304 [breakthrough]: Builds a coherent primitive-class-number pipeline and obtains a stable numeric result, but still on the wrong discriminant branch.
- Token 81722 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{17447}`, which is incorrect.
