## Answer: wrong (25540)

## Key moments
- Token 499 [insight]: Correctly reformulates the target as \(\sum e^{k_i/n}\approx \pi+4\), which is the right search objective.
- Token 2090 [questionable statement]: Introduces the idea that scaling the \(n=200\) structure might transfer directly to \(n=10000\), a risky assumption for a discrete argmin.
- Token 2618 [insight]: Identifies meet-in-the-middle as the principled global method for this 4-sum-style optimization.
- Token 3139-12128 [wasted]: Enters a long theoretical detour (continuous/Lagrange analysis and structural speculation) instead of executing a global discrete search.
- Token 10696 [missed opportunity]: Reaches the point of proposing an algorithmic/computational route, but diverts back into non-decisive analytic exploration.
- Token 18251 [missed opportunity]: Again outlines search/plausible enumeration strategies but does not execute a full \(n=10000\) meet-in-the-middle run.
- Token 27012-28723 [wasted]: Repeats pair-count and memory sizing loops without transitioning to a complete exact solve.
- Token 33641-34943 [wasted]: Continues heuristic and asymptotic reasoning about \(g(n)\) trends rather than proving the global optimum for the target \(n\).
- Token 40258 [missed opportunity]: Shifts to bounded/random heuristic plans, despite already having enough context to justify exact global search.
- Token 44763 [questionable statement]: Shifts toward heuristic/stochastic and formula-guessing narratives despite not having a global certificate.
- Token 45133 [missed opportunity]: Again states a global meet-in-the-middle plan but does not carry it through.
- Token 46408 [mistake]: Uses continuous-optimum-style \(g\) estimation as an answer direction, which does not solve the discrete minimization defining \(g(10000)\).
- Token 51782 [insight]: Derives a tractable elimination search for the restricted pattern \((a,a,b,c)\): solve one variable from \(C-2E[a]-E[b]\).
- Token 52421 [breakthrough]: Runs that restricted search and finds a strong candidate \((6086,6086,6324,4598)\) with error around \(1.85\times10^{-12}\).
- Token 52636 [questionable statement]: Treats the best restricted-pattern candidate as likely global optimum.
- Token 55173 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly notes all-distinct quadruples could still beat the current result but does not perform a conclusive global search.
- Token 59276 [questionable statement]: Finalizes the assumption that the two-equal pattern is globally optimal.
- Token 59293 [mistake]: Commits to \(g(10000)=135{,}213{,}372\) from the restricted-pattern solution, not the true global minimizer.
- Token 59541 [final answer]: Outputs modulo \(99991\) as \(25540\), which is incorrect.
