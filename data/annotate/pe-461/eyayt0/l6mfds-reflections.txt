## Answer: correct (34658)

## Key moments
- Token 3455 [insight]: Identifies meet-in-the-middle as the right global strategy for the 4-term closest-sum search.
- Token 3561-12720 [wasted]: Long heuristic/theoretical detour (pattern speculation and local reasoning) before executing the decisive global search.
- Token 12720 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly notes the need for a broader/global search but continues with local/heuristic exploration.
- Token 20261 [insight]: Runs structured local search around the scaled seed and gets a better candidate tuple, showing the scaled tuple is not optimal.
- Token 28824 [questionable statement]: Starts considering trust in the heuristic candidate despite lacking a global optimality certificate.
- Token 32181 [mistake]: Leans toward treating \((314,3737,4433,11310)\) as effectively optimal based on practicality, which is not globally correct.
- Token 32673 [insight]: Switches to a memory-reduced low/high split implementation that makes full pair-space search feasible.
- Token 33167 [insight]: Confirms the monotone two-pointer merge logic for closest low+high pair sums, enabling a complete global sweep.
- Token 37095 [breakthrough]: Full search finds a much better solution (error near \(10^{-15}\)), overturning the earlier heuristic candidate.
- Token 37409 [verification]: Checks why the low/high merge covers the global minimum rather than a local artifact.
- Token 39558 [verification]: Reconstructs the exact quadruple and verifies \(\sum f_n(k)\) matches \(\pi\) to near machine precision.
- Token 39728 [final answer]: Commits to \(g(10000)=159820276\), then \(g(10000)\bmod 99991=34658\).
