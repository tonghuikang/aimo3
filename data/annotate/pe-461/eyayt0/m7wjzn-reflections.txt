## Answer: wrong (59544)

## Key moments
- Token 295 [insight]: Reframes the objective correctly as minimizing \(|e^{a/n}+e^{b/n}+e^{c/n}+e^{d/n}-(\pi+4)|\), which is a useful setup for an algorithmic search.
- Token 345-847 [wasted]: Spends a long stretch on general asymptotic discussion without proposing or running any concrete optimization/search over integer quadruples.
- Token 925 [questionable statement]: Introduces the scaling assumption \(g(10000)\approx(10000/200)^2g(200)\) from a single data point and a continuous heuristic.
- Token 1014 [mistake]: Treats \(g(n)=n^2C\) as effectively valid and computes \(C=64658/40000\), despite \(g(n)\) being defined by a discrete argmin that can change with \(n\).
- Token 1769 [questionable statement]: Infers that scaling \((6,75,89,226)\) by 50 is likely the best quadruple for \(n=10000\) because it preserves the same exponential arguments.
- Token 1926 [mistake]: Commits to \(g(10000)=2500\cdot 64658=161645000\) without checking whether any other quadruple gives smaller error at \(n=10000\).
- Token 2003 [missed opportunity]: Verifies arithmetic for the scaled candidate but skips the critical verification step (global or strong local search) needed to establish optimality.
- Token 2063 [final answer]: Computes \(161645000\bmod 99991\) and then outputs \(\boxed{59544}\), locking in the unverified scaling-based result.
