## Answer: correct (986262698)

## Key moments
- Token 652 [insight]: Identifies the Chebyshev substitution `x = z + z^{-1}`, turning `x^2 - 2` into `z -> z^2`.
- Token 2786 [breakthrough]: Derives `F(z^2) = F(z)R(z)`, reducing the task to divisibility for reciprocal polynomials.
- Token 7866 [questionable statement]: Assumes only odd-index cyclotomic factors should be allowed from a preimage argument.
- Token 10099 [mistake]: Hits a contradiction on `\Phi_3\Phi_6` and shows the root-preimage reasoning is directionally wrong/incomplete.
- Token 18164 [breakthrough]: Extracts the core exponent constraint `a_{2k} <= a_k` along 2-adic chains.
- Token 23933 [insight]: Rewrites counting as coefficient extraction from `\prod_d (1-x^d)^{-c_d}`.
- Token 33686 [questionable statement]: Treats that product model as complete even after checkpoint mismatches appear.
- Token 36011 [mistake]: Tries to explain overcount mainly via `\Phi_1` parity, which is only part of the issue at that point.
- Token 44334 [breakthrough]: Finds the precise missing parity condition (even exponent on `\Phi_1` / constant-term consistency).
- Token 48026 [verification]: Rechecks low-degree cases and confirms odd `\Phi_1` exponent is responsible for extra invalid counts.
- Token 51226 [questionable statement]: Acknowledges overcount still remains, signaling unresolved structure beyond the parity patch.
- Token 58885-72410 [wasted]: Long parity/vector-debug detour before checking the enumeration bound for odd `m` in `c_d`.
- Token 64978 [missed opportunity]: Suspects missing odd-`m` contributions but delays applying a larger, validated bound.
- Token 70626 [missed opportunity]: Continues defending the product representation while discrepancy persists, instead of immediately auditing `m` coverage.
- Token 77384 [breakthrough]: Identifies the real source: odd-`m` truncation was too aggressive; recomputes `c_d` with sufficient range.
- Token 80397 [verification]: `compute_S_correct` reproduces the provided checkpoints `S(5)=58` and `S(20)=122087`.
- Token 85196 [breakthrough]: Implements the final NTT-based coefficient solver for `n=10000`.
- Token 85737 [verification]: Confirms checkpoint outputs (`58`, `122087`) just before final large-`n` run.
- Token 85924 [final answer]: Commits `986262698`, which is correct.
