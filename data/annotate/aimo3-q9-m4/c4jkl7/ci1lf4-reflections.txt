## Answer: wrong (16)

## Key moments
- Token 1765 [insight]: Introduces generating functions `A(x)` and `B(x)` and rewrites the shift-inner-product condition as a product equation, which is the right global framing.
- Token 2123 [breakthrough]: Derives that the target has form `x^k(1+x^d)` and links shiftyness to divisibility structure of `A` against a two-monomial polynomial.
- Token 3427 [questionable statement]: Treats the Laurent-polynomial divisibility condition as if it forces ordinary polynomial divisibility by `1+x^d` without tracking monomial-shift freedom in `A`.
- Token 6023 [mistake]: Imposes `a_0=\pm 1` and excludes shifted valid patterns, eliminating many admissible `\alpha` with leading zeros (i.e., monomial-shifted divisors).
- Token 7045 [questionable statement]: Sets the counting formula to `2 * (# monic divisors)` and silently drops multiplicity from allowable shifts inside the length-5 support window.
- Token 12269 [mistake]: Converts the reduced set into `2*8=16`, counting only signed primitive divisors and not positional shifts within indices `0..4`.
- Token 14969-20719 [wasted]: Repeats factor-class checks and consistency checks under the same flawed assumption instead of re-testing the missing shift degree-of-freedom.
- Token 18791 [verification]: Runs computational checks for the enumerated candidates, but this verification is constrained by the same undercounting model so it cannot falsify the core omission.
- Token 21088 [missed opportunity]: Explicitly reconsiders edge cases but does not revisit the earlier Laurent-vs-polynomial step where the missing shift multiplicity would have corrected the count.
- Token 21587 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{16}`, which is inconsistent with the full shifted-divisor count.
