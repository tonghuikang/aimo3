## Answer: wrong (16)

## Key moments
- Token 1883 [insight]: Converts the shift-inner-product condition into a generating-function product framework.
- Token 2654 [breakthrough]: Correctly frames the requirement as Laurent divisibility of a binomial `1+x^d` (up to monomial units).
- Token 3163 [questionable statement]: Starts replacing Laurent divisibility with plain `\mathbb{Z}[x]` divisibility, which risks losing monomial-shift freedom.
- Token 3438 [mistake]: Enforces `a_0\neq0`/no `x`-factor logic, excluding valid shifted solutions `A=x^rP` that still satisfy the original Laurent condition.
- Token 4455 [questionable statement]: Moves to subset enumeration of low-degree cyclotomics without a stable compatibility check, creating repeated counting drift.
- Token 9289 [insight]: Regains structure via `v_2`-based compatibility constraints for factors appearing in one `x^d+1`.
- Token 15328 [mistake]: Commits to `20` from an inconsistent subset/degree tally (still missing the shift multiplicity mechanism).
- Token 19564 [breakthrough]: Corrects pair-compatibility logic and removes invalid mixed-factor products.
- Token 22476-24418 [wasted]: Extended recounting and code-assisted subset debugging under the same unshifted-divisor model instead of fixing the core missing-shift count.
- Token 23583 [mistake]: Finalizes to `16` by counting signed primitive divisors only, still omitting `x^r` shift variants within support `0..4`.
- Token 24012 [verification]: Runs brute-force divisor enumeration, but verifies only the restricted unshifted interpretation.
- Token 24957 [missed opportunity]: Audits the 16 divisor shapes carefully yet does not reintroduce the dropped monomial-shift family.
- Token 25504 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{16}`, which is below the full count.
