Correct answer: 40632119

Correct approach
- Model each floor as a chain of occupants where consecutive occupants sum to perfect squares.
- For floor 1: `P(1,r) = r(r+1)/2` (triangular numbers).
- For floor `f >= 2`, the first occupant is `a_f = floor(f^2/2)`.
- For floor `f >= 2`, a closed form that matches all checks is:
  - `base = r(r-1)/2`
  - If `f` is even: `P(f,r) = floor(f^2/2) + base + floor(r/2) * (2f)`
  - If `f` is odd: `P(f,r) = floor(f^2/2) + base + floor((r-1)/2) * (2f-2)`
- This formula reproduces the prompt examples:
  - `P(10,20)=440`
  - `P(25,75)=4863`
  - `P(99,100)=19454`
- Let `N = 71328803586048 = 2^27 * 3^12`.  
  Sum over all ordered factor pairs by iterating divisors `f | N`, with `r = N/f`:
  - `S = sum_{f|N} P(f, N/f)`
  - Number of terms: `(27+1)(12+1)=364`
  - Last 8 digits: `S mod 10^8 = 40632119`.

Wrong approaches and why they fail
- Wrong first-occupant formula from miscounted parity sums:
  - Tried `a_f = f(f+1)/2 - ceil(f/2) + 1`
  - Immediately fails (`a_2=3`, `a_3=5` instead of `2,4`).
- Wrong parity-offset correction in summed increments:
  - Used correction factors `(2f-1)` / `(2f-3)` directly against a `(k-1)` base.
  - Produces wrong values, e.g. predicts `P(2,5)=18` instead of `20`.
  - Correct correction terms are `2f` (even-floor matched parity) and `2f-2` (odd-floor matched parity).
- Overly heuristic pattern-guessing (`ratio fits`, ad hoc quadratic guesses, OEIS-name hunting) is unproductive here; direct recurrence + parity counting gives the stable derivation.
