## Answer: wrong (30986)

## Key moments
- Token 416 [insight]: It recognizes that matching only `m^2 mod p` is insufficient and the target digit can appear in higher base-`p` positions.
- Token 2837 [breakthrough]: It states the right high-level condition `floor(m^2/p) mod p = d`, which is the form needed to include carries (`k*p + d`).
- Token 3274 [questionable statement]: It narrows the fallback to `floor(m^2/p) = p-e`, implicitly fixing the carry term to `k=0`.
- Token 3646 [mistake]: It treats the single interval `[p(p-e), p(p-e+1))` as the complete second-digit search, omitting valid `k>=1` intervals.
- Token 5322 [questionable statement]: It claims that if the `k=0` second-digit interval fails, the next meaningful option is the third digit.
- Token 5383 [mistake]: It codifies `M` via `m1/m2` (then `m3`) without any `k` loop for second-digit hits, which overestimates many cases.
- Token 15322 [questionable statement]: It concludes a broad class must jump to third-digit solutions after the `k=0` miss.
- Token 16574 [mistake]: It operationally accepts many third-digit assignments that should have been replaced by smaller second-digit solutions from `k>0`.
- Token 19452-21256 [wasted]: Long self-consistency checks revalidate the same incomplete candidate set instead of probing the missing `k>0` branch.
- Token 21453 [missed opportunity]: It rechecks the final modulo but never falsifies the `k=0` assumption with a direct constructive test for second-digit carries.
- Token 22215 [final answer]: It commits to `\boxed{30986}`, which is not the correct value.
