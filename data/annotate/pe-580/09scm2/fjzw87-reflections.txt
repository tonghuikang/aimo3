## Answer: wrong (0)

## Key moments
- Token 719 [insight]: Starts from a prime-exponent perspective and frames the condition around forbidden Hilbert-square divisibility.
- Token 2595 [breakthrough]: Builds a Möbius-style inclusion-exclusion direction and tries to formalize `f_H(n)` via square divisors.
- Token 3294 [verification]: Early small-`N` mismatch tests show the naive restricted-Möbius setup is not immediately consistent.
- Token 8944 [breakthrough]: Correctly derives structural exponent constraints (`p ≡ 1` exponents at most 1; `p ≡ 3` exponents in `{0,1,2,3}` with coupling constraints).
- Token 9757 [insight]: Adds the global parity condition required by `n ≡ 1 (mod 4)`.
- Token 12290 [questionable statement]: Commits to long Dirichlet-series manipulations before validating coefficient correctness.
- Token 15432 [questionable statement]: Treats the Hilbert monoid as if unique factorization into “Hilbert primes” were safely usable for sieve-style Möbius construction.
- Token 17747 [mistake]: Concludes H-squarefree numbers are exactly products of distinct Hilbert primes; later checks contradict this.
- Token 18482 [missed opportunity]: The `189` counterexample already signals modeling trouble, but the trace continues in the same framework.
- Token 23789-29968 [wasted]: Extended Euler-product/L-function algebra does not produce a validated exact-count pipeline.
- Token 28564 [mistake]: Simplifies to a compact generating-formula factor `(1 + P3(2s))` and proceeds as if it were proven operationally.
- Token 30963 [questionable statement]: Proposes linear-sieving `μ_H` with smallest-factor logic that depends on unique factorization.
- Token 32251-37844 [wasted]: Large implementation detour around Hilbert-prime sieve mechanics before the foundational assumption is verified.
- Token 43057 [verification]: Low-limit tests appear promising and temporarily reinforce the flawed sieve approach.
- Token 47189 [verification]: Wider checks (`10^4` to `10^6`) still disagree with brute force, revealing a systemic issue.
- Token 56097 [mistake]: Identifies the core failure: linear sieve is invalid here because Hilbert-factorization is not unique.
- Token 57295 [breakthrough]: Switches to recurrence/Dirichlet-inverse style computation for coefficients instead of SPF-based linear sieve.
- Token 59813 [verification]: `10^7` checkpoint still misses the known value, so the coefficient/counting model remains unresolved.
- Token 66612 [breakthrough]: Returns to the correct exponent-constraint description as a reliable structural model.
- Token 70390 [questionable statement]: Re-enters unverified generating-function execution path instead of locking a benchmark-passing algorithm.
- Token 74411 [insight]: Distinguishes inclusion-exclusion coefficients `c(d)` from the attempted `μ_H` surrogate, clarifying why prior sums drifted.
- Token 81404 [mistake]: Confirms coefficient/indicator mismatch on known non-squarefree examples (e.g., `3969`), invalidating the current sum formula.
- Token 82767-87814 [wasted]: Prolonged brainstorming (DFS/asymptotic/heuristic) without landing a correct, validated computation.
- Token 87922 [questionable statement]: Floats naive scaling from `10^7`, which cannot provide an exact answer.
- Token 89234 [mistake]: Abandons derivation and prepares a placeholder output.
- Token 89381 [final answer]: Commits `\boxed{0}`.
