## Answer: correct (30815)

## Key moments
- Token 809 [insight]: Reframes the task as counting `n ≡ 1 (mod 4)` that avoid divisibility by squares of Hilbert roots.
- Token 2316 [breakthrough]: Derives prime-exponent constraints (`p ≡ 1` exponents at most 1; `p ≡ 3` can reach 3 but not 4).
- Token 4351 [questionable statement]: Briefly overgeneralizes the forbidden set toward "odd square divisor" language, which risks conflating `h^2` with arbitrary odd squares.
- Token 6476 [missed opportunity]: Delays checking against the provided `10^7` benchmark, so incorrect formulas survive longer than necessary.
- Token 7983-13478 [wasted]: Long detour on density/implementation strategy before fixing the underlying counting identity.
- Token 14551 [mistake]: Commits to an incorrect counting kernel using only `d ≡ 1 (mod 4)` in `F`, which produces mismatched counts.
- Token 18342 [breakthrough]: Explicitly discards the broken indicator approach and rebuilds the decomposition from exponent-structure constraints.
- Token 22305 [insight]: Finds a cancellation pattern for exponent-2/exponent-3 `q ≡ 3 (mod 4)` contributions, reducing the form to reusable `F(⌊N/q^k⌋)` terms.
- Token 22613 [questionable statement]: Treats `F(N) + Σ(F(⌊N/q^2⌋) - F(⌊N/q^4⌋))` as settled too early, before edge-case validation.
- Token 24816 [mistake]: First closed-form attempt fails small-`N` brute checks.
- Token 32287-45554 [wasted]: Extended algebra/debug loop around `q^4`/`q^5` correction terms without converging quickly.
- Token 52506 [insight]: Identifies that the squarefree baseline `F` itself was misdefined, which narrows the root cause of the mismatches.
- Token 55812 [questionable statement]: Temporarily adds an extra `S_-(N/q^5)` correction term without full consistency.
- Token 56188 [mistake]: This variant gives `2,739,305` at `10^7`, contradicting the known value `2,327,192`.
- Token 58762 [breakthrough]: Repairs `F(N)` by summing over odd squarefree divisors (not restricting to `d ≡ 1 (mod 4)`), fixing the baseline count.
- Token 59420 [insight]: Restates a clean case split (fully squarefree base plus one distinguished `q ≡ 3 (mod 4)` with elevated exponent), enabling a stable final formula.
- Token 63228 [breakthrough]: Resolves over-subtraction around singleton `q^2` handling in the contribution derivation.
- Token 68742 [breakthrough]: Settles the usable identity `G(N) = F(N) + Σ_{q ≡ 3 (mod 4)} F(⌊N/q^2⌋)`.
- Token 71331 [verification]: Rechecks against the statement benchmark and recovers `G(10^7) = 2,327,192` exactly.
- Token 76549 [verification]: Runs the full `N = 10^16` computation pipeline with cached `F` evaluations and prime aggregation.
- Token 78878 [final answer]: Commits `\boxed{30815}`.
