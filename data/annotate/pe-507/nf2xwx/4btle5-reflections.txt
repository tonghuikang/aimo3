## Answer: correct (316558047002627270)

## Key moments
- Token 93 [insight]: Correctly anchors the computation around 12-term blocks feeding each `(V_n, W_n)` pair.
- Token 4431 [insight]: Uses the provided `\sum_{n=1}^{10} S(n)` value as a hard falsification test for simple heuristics.
- Token 5759 [questionable statement]: Prioritizes exact cancellation of the huge third coordinate as if that should drive the global L1 minimum.
- Token 11663 [mistake]: Confirms that forcing third-coordinate cancellation can require large coefficients and inflate the first two coordinates, so it is not a valid minimization rule.
- Token 14361-16333 [wasted]: Extended formula-guessing (`gcd`/determinant-style shortcuts) without a correctness criterion for the lattice L1 objective.
- Token 16682 [insight]: Moves to Gauss-reduced basis reasoning and short-candidate enumeration for the rank-2 lattice.
- Token 20584 [breakthrough]: Establishes the reliable candidate set `{b1, b2, b1+b2, b1-b2}` after reduction and matches the known small-`N` checksum.
- Token 24568 [questionable statement]: Assumes the streaming tribonacci index/state update is correct before detailed index-level validation.
- Token 25332 [mistake]: Debugging reveals an indexing/state-shift bug (early terms become inconsistent, e.g., wrong `t3`), invalidating the first implementation.
- Token 27242 [insight]: Repaired streaming recurrence and block extraction now reproduce the calibration target.
- Token 30805 [verification]: Re-checks the optimized implementation on `N=10` to confirm `130762273722`.
- Token 31127 [verification]: Executes the full `N=20,000,000` run and records the final computed sum.
- Token 31675 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{316558047002627270}`.
