# PE_787 Findings

## Correct Answer
- H(10^9) mod 99991 = 91904.

## Correct Position Classification
- For coprime positive (a,b), losing positions are exactly opposite-parity pairs where the odd value is larger than the even value.
- Equivalent forms:
- (a even, b odd, b > a) is losing.
- (a odd, b even, a > b) is losing.
- All other valid states are winning (including all min(a,b)=1 states and all both-odd coprime states).

## Correct Counting Setup
- Let S(N) = sum_{s=2..N} phi(s), the total number of ordered coprime pairs (a,b) with a+b <= N.
- Let O(N) = sum over even s <= N of phi(s), the number of ordered coprime pairs with both entries odd.
- Opposite-parity count is S(N)-O(N).
- By symmetry, exactly half of opposite-parity pairs have odd > even (losing), so:
- L(N) = (S(N)-O(N))/2.
- H(N) = S(N)-L(N) = (S(N)+O(N))/2.
- This reproduces the provided checks H(4)=5 and H(100)=2043.

## Computational Approach
- Compute S(N) and O(N) with fast summatory totient / Mobius methods (memoized floor-division grouping, O(N^(2/3))-style complexity), then apply the formula above and reduce modulo 99991.

## Wrong Approaches That Fail
- Depth-parity or continued-fraction-parity classifiers on Stern-Brocot/Calkin-Wilf paths.
- Boolean/NAND/fractal label recurrences as a proxy for exact arithmetic counting.
- Late-stage curve fitting of losing counts without a proven exact invariant.
- These fail because they miss the true invariant: parity plus odd/even ordering (odd > even).
