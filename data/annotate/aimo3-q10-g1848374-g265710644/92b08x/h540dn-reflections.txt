## Answer: correct (5577)

## Key moments
- Token 3542 [insight]: establishes that the target scale forces work near `M`, motivating an offset-based parameterization instead of raw brute force over `N`.
- Token 5009 [breakthrough]: derives the congruence form `M+c-s \equiv 0 \pmod{\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)}` with `s=a+b`, turning the problem into arithmetic constraints.
- Token 12000 [wasted]: spends a long segment on broad upper/lower bound discussion that does not materially narrow candidates.
- Token 18000 [missed opportunity]: revisits generic growth bounds again instead of exploiting the stronger modulus structure already available.
- Token 25000 [insight]: recognizes the need to optimize divisor-sum constructions through parameterized forms rather than ad hoc examples.
- Token 30222 [wasted]: continues exploratory numerics and heuristics without yet locking onto the decisive ratio-minimization criterion.
- Token 36084 [insight]: reframes viable constructions as `N + N/p + N/q = n`, exposing the ratio `pq/(pq+p+q)` and divisibility gates.
- Token 40010 [breakthrough]: formalizes that minimizing this ratio under integrality conditions controls minimal `f(n)`.
- Token 44981 [questionable statement]: treats the `(p,q)=(2,6)` branch as valid from reduced-denominator divisibility alone.
- Token 45036 [mistake]: accepts `N=3n/5` as a candidate path before verifying that `N` is actually divisible by `2` (required for `N/2` to be a divisor).
- Token 55000 [insight]: parity check shows `(M+c)/5` is odd in the target cases, so `N=3(M+c)/5` is odd and the `(2,6)` construction is invalid.
- Token 60151 [breakthrough]: switches to the correct optimal feasible ratios, obtaining `f(M+c_1)/n_1=16/25` and `f(M+c_2)/n_2=64/97`.
- Token 60653 [verification]: confirms these yield exact `g(c_1)=16/25` and `g(c_2)=64/97` under the floor scaling.
- Token 64607-65167 [verification]: runs small-scale brute checks (e.g., `n=775`, `n=776`) that match the derived ratio behavior.
- Token 65368 [final answer]: commits to `5577` (correct).
