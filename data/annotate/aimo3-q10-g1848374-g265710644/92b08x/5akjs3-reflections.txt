## Answer: wrong (35862)

## Key moments
- Token 2144 [insight]: introduces the `n=M+D` setup and focuses on representing `M+D` as `N` plus two divisors of `N`.
- Token 6556 [breakthrough]: reframes minimization as maximizing `T=a+b` with `N=M+D-T` under divisor constraints, giving a concrete optimization target.
- Token 12000 [missed opportunity]: explores structural divisor choices but does not rigorously separate “constructing some `N`” from “proving globally minimal `f(n)`.”
- Token 20721 [questionable statement]: asserts that once `f` is below `M`, the floor forces `g(c)=1-1/2025!`, effectively treating `g` as a binary outcome.
- Token 28253 [insight]: derives the explicit family `N=\frac{pq(M+D)}{pq+p+q}` and recognizes ratio minimization under divisibility conditions.
- Token 28325 [breakthrough]: formalizes the `p,q` (or `d=pq+p+q`) search for admissible constructions with minimal ratio.
- Token 31782 [verification]: runs computational checks and finds admissible cases (`d=31` for `c_1`, `d=97` for `c_2`) showing `f(M+c)<M` constructions exist.
- Token 33324 [missed opportunity]: notices the ratio-order subtlety across different `d` but does not carry that concern through to recomputing `g(c)` from exact ratios.
- Token 34043 [mistake]: applies the earlier binary-floor rule and concludes both `g(c)` values are `1-1/2025!`, discarding the actual magnitudes implied by the found ratios.
- Token 34424-34948 [wasted]: performs extensive fraction-reduction and modular arithmetic on the already-wrong `g` expression.
- Token 35834 [verification]: rechecks arithmetic consistency of `35862` under the incorrect model, reinforcing the wrong branch.
- Token 38755 [final answer]: commits to `\boxed{35862}` (incorrect).
