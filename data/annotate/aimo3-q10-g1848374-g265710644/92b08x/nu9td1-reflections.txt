## Answer: correct (5577)

## Key moments
- Token 12078 [insight]: identifies a largest-divisor-of-`n-1` route and treats it as the dominant way to minimize `f(n)`.
- Token 12126 [breakthrough]: commits to `f(M+c_1)=(10/11)S_1` under that heuristic.
- Token 12126-18782 [wasted]: long continuation on the same heuristic branch before re-evaluating the structural assumption.
- Token 14301 [insight]: mirrors the same heuristic structure for the second target value.
- Token 14310 [breakthrough]: extends to `f(M+c_2)=(3/4)S_2` and proceeds with floor arithmetic from this model.
- Token 16832 [questionable statement]: reduces to a concrete `p/q` from the heuristic branch without establishing global optimality over all divisor-structure families.
- Token 16874 [mistake]: concludes interim `p+q=117`, a wrong local optimum.
- Token 19755 [missed opportunity]: builds implementation around the current formula instead of earlier stress-testing whether the model captures all minimal constructions.
- Token 25964 [insight]: recognizes that the prior `1,d,n-1-d` style is only one subfamily and may miss smaller LCM constructions.
- Token 30160 [breakthrough]: pivots to the correct global decomposition `f(n)=\min_{d\mid n} d\,G(n/d)` and reframes the target as minimizing `G(m)/m` on admissible divisors.
- Token 34026 [insight]: starts explicit `G(m)/m` profiling, creating the low-ratio comparison basis needed for the final selection.
- Token 35131 [breakthrough]: identifies strong low-ratio templates (e.g., `G(11)=6`) and uses them as competitive baselines.
- Token 37914 [insight]: narrows feasible divisor sets for the two instances from modular/divisibility structure.
- Token 41117 [breakthrough]: correctly isolates admissible winners leading to `16/25` and `64/97` (replacing the earlier `10/11`, `3/4` path).
- Token 48143 [verification]: checks that floor scaling gives `g(c)=G(m)/m` exactly because the `c/M` perturbation is negligible.
- Token 48655 [final answer]: outputs `\boxed{5577}` (correct).
