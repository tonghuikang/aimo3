## Answer: wrong (11)

## Key moments
- Token 290 [insight]: identifies the LCM-minimization framing for three divisors summing to `n`, which is the first concrete optimization lens.
- Token 1237 [breakthrough]: formalizes `f(n)=\min \operatorname{lcm}(a,b,c)` over distinct triples with `a+b+c=n`, giving a workable global objective.
- Token 8962 [insight]: derives the structural lower bound `X \ge (6/11)S`, motivating ratio-based analysis instead of raw construction guessing.
- Token 10003 [breakthrough]: rewrites the target as `S = X + a + b`, then treats minimizing `X/S` as the central task.
- Token 14981 [missed opportunity]: notes the `6/11` lower bound is not attained in the current line of search, but does not broaden the candidate family enough at that point.
- Token 20939 [insight]: expresses candidates as `X = S\,d_1d_2/(d_1d_2+d_1+d_2)`, exposing the reduced denominator `v` divisibility gate.
- Token 28316 [breakthrough]: converts feasibility to checking reduced `v` against `\Delta+1` and starts explicit admissible-ratio enumeration.
- Token 30763 [verification]: runs a bounded brute-force search over `(d_1,d_2)` and confirms `3/5` is best within the adopted framework.
- Token 32033 [questionable statement]: assumes one shared admissible-minimum condition across both `c_1` and `c_2` (via common `v`), rather than minimizing each `g(c)` independently.
- Token 32555 [mistake]: commits to `g(c_1)=g(c_2)=3/5` and concludes answer `11`, which conflicts with the correct target value.
- Token 34152-34884 [wasted]: long post-conclusion re-derivation reiterates pair ordering and factor checks without changing the already-fixed wrong conclusion.
- Token 36235 [final answer]: outputs `\boxed{11}` as the final committed result (incorrect).
