## Answer: correct (5577)

## Key moments
- Token 528 [insight]: reframes one candidate family as `1,d,N` with `N=n-1-d` and `d\mid N`.
- Token 623 [breakthrough]: converts the condition to divisor arithmetic on `n-1`, giving a concrete minimization handle over feasible `d`.
- Token 7026 [questionable statement]: assumes the smallest odd prime factor route from `n-1` (via `c`) is the decisive global optimizer for `f(n)`.
- Token 8525 [mistake]: commits to `f(n)=(n-1)(p-1)/p` from that route, which is only a restricted subfamily and not globally minimal here.
- Token 15026-20058 [wasted]: spends a long stretch refining that subfamily (including exception patching) before reopening the global search.
- Token 20058 [missed opportunity]: could have stress-tested global optimality earlier with small constructive counterexamples instead of extending the same branch.
- Token 29195 [insight]: introduces the broader `N + N/a + N/b = n` construction and ratio target `ab/(ab+a+b)`.
- Token 30066 [breakthrough]: formalizes denominator feasibility checks (`D'`, reduced divisibility conditions) for systematic candidate testing.
- Token 30735 [questionable statement]: treats reduced-denominator divisibility (`D''\mid n`) as sufficient for feasibility of `(2,6)`.
- Token 31157-40027 [wasted]: long detour around the `0.6` branch with repeated algebra/debugging before isolating the missing integrality requirement.
- Token 31816 [mistake]: concludes `f(n)\le 3n/5` from `(2,6)`, which is invalid for these parities/residues.
- Token 40027 [insight]: sanity check on a smaller analogue (`M=81,c=4`) exposes that the chosen `N` need not be divisible by required divisors.
- Token 49089 [breakthrough]: corrects feasibility to the stronger `D1\mid n` condition (here `10\nmid n`), eliminating the false `0.6` candidate.
- Token 49819 [insight]: identifies a valid low-ratio candidate `(a,b)=(2,16)` with ratio `16/25` for `c_1`.
- Token 50097 [breakthrough]: verifies `D1=25` divisibility and confirms `g(c_1)=16/25`.
- Token 50502 [insight]: search output isolates `(a,b)=(2,64)` as the best surviving candidate for `c_2`.
- Token 50692 [breakthrough]: verifies the `97` divisibility condition and locks `g(c_2)=64/97`.
- Token 53477 [verification]: brute-force scans over broad `(a,b)` ranges support that no smaller valid ratios were missed.
- Token 56836 [final answer]: outputs `\boxed{5577}` (correct).
