Correct answer: 5577

Correct approach:
- Let n = M + c and view f(n) as minimizing a construction with three distinct divisors of N summing to n.
- The decisive family is N + N/a + N/b = n with integers a,b > 1, a != b. Then
  N = n * ab / (ab + a + b), so minimizing f(n) is minimizing ratio ab/(ab+a+b) among feasible (a,b).
- Feasibility is not only N integer: N/a and N/b must also be integers. With D = ab+a+b, require
  D_a = D/gcd(D,a), D_b = D/gcd(D,b), D1 = lcm(D_a,D_b), and D1 | n.
- For mod checks, M = 3^(2025!) implies M ≡ 1 (mod m) for m <= 2025 and gcd(m,3)=1, so D1 | (M+c) becomes a congruence on c.
- For c1 = 1848374, best feasible pair is (a,b) = (2,16): ratio 16/25, so g(c1)=16/25.
- For c2 = 265710644, best feasible pair is (a,b) = (2,64): ratio 64/97, so g(c2)=64/97.
- Therefore g(c1)+g(c2)=16/25+64/97=3152/2425, so p+q=5577 and the required remainder mod 99991 is 5577.

Wrong approaches and why they fail:
- Restricting to the subfamily 1,d,N (largest-divisor-of-(n-1) heuristic): this gives local values like g(c1)=10/11 and g(c2)=3/4, yielding p+q=117. It is not globally optimal because smaller valid N from N+N/a+N/b exist.
- Treating reduced denominator divisibility alone as sufficient (e.g., accepting (a,b)=(2,6) via a reduced condition and concluding ratio 3/5): this misses the stronger integrality requirement that N/a and N/b must both be integers. This branch leads to wrong value g(c1)=g(c2)=3/5 and wrong result p+q=11.
- Binary floor misconception ("if f(M+c)<M then g(c)=1-1/2025!"): g(c) is not a binary indicator; it tracks the actual scaled ratio f(M+c)/M. This produces wrong outputs such as 35862.
