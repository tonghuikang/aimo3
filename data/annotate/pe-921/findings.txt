Correct answer (mod 398874989): 378401935

Correct approach:
- Rewrite the recurrence as
  `a_{n+1} = (a_n^5 + 10a_n^3 + 5a_n)/(5a_n^4 + 10a_n^2 + 1)`,
  which matches the 5-angle identity for `coth`, not `tanh`.
- Set `a_n = coth(5^n x0)` with `a_0 = (1+sqrt(5))/2`, so
  `exp(2x0) = 2 + sqrt(5)`.
- Let `(2+sqrt(5))^(5^n) = A_n + B_n sqrt(5)`. Then
  `a_n = (B_n sqrt(5) + 1)/A_n`, so `p_n = B_n`, `q_n = A_n`,
  and `s(n) = B_n^5 + A_n^5`.
- For terms in the sum, use `n = F_i`, so the core exponent is `5^(F_i)`.
  Modulo prime `M = 398874989`, reduce powers in the multiplicative group:
  compute `e_i = 5^(F_i) (mod M-1)`.
- Use the Fibonacci-exponent recurrence
  `e_1 = e_2 = 5`, `e_i = e_{i-1} * e_{i-2} (mod M-1)`,
  which avoids huge-`F_i` exponentiation each step.
- For each `e_i`, evaluate the corresponding `A_n, B_n` modulo `M` via
  `alpha = (2+sqrt(5))^(e_i) (mod M)` and its conjugate/inverse relation,
  then accumulate `A_n^5 + B_n^5 (mod M)` for `i = 2..1618034`.

Wrong approaches and why they fail:
- Treating the recurrence as a real `tanh(5*atanh(.))` iterate all the way through:
  `a_0 > 1`, so the real-branch `atanh` framing is invalid; the stable real formulation is via `coth`.
- Attempting to propagate raw integer `p_n, q_n` directly:
  growth is far too large, and this is infeasible at Fibonacci indices of this size.
- Recomputing `5^(F_i) mod (M-1)` from scratch for every `i`:
  mathematically correct but unnecessarily expensive; the multiplicative Fibonacci recurrence for `e_i` is the key optimization.
- Assuming sign/parity behavior from unreduced `5^(F_i)` always carries through after modular reduction:
  conjugate-sign handling must use the effective exponent in modular arithmetic.
