## Problem Summary
- Let `M = 3^(2025!)`.
- `f(n)` is the smallest positive integer having three distinct positive divisors summing to `n`.
- `g(0) = (1/2025!) * floor(2025! * f(M) / M)`.
- **Correct final answer:** `5`.

## Correct Approach
1. Write the three divisors in the minimizing construction as `N`, `N/p`, `N/q` with `p,q > 1`, `p != q`, and `p,q | N`.
2. From
   `N + N/p + N/q = M`,
   get
   `N = M * pq / (pq + p + q)`.
3. Since `M` is a pure power of `3`, integrality forces the reduced denominator to be a power of `3`; the clean minimizing branch is to solve
   `pq + p + q = 3^s`.
4. Check small `p`:
   - `p=2` gives `3q+2=3^s`, impossible modulo `3`.
   - `p=3` gives `q=(3^s-3)/4`; the smallest valid case is `s=3`, `q=6`.
5. This gives ratio
   `N/M = pq/(pq+p+q) = 18/27 = 2/3`,
   so
   `f(M) = (2/3)M = 2*3^(2025!-1)`.
6. Then
   `g(0) = floor((2/3)2025!) / 2025! = 2/3`
   because `3 | 2025!`.
   Hence `(p,q)=(2,3)`, so `p+q=5`, and mod `99991` is `5`.

## Wrong Approach Families

### 1) Over-restricting divisors to powers of `3` (or to `N=M`)
- Pattern:
  Assume the useful divisors must look like `{1, 3^a, 3^b}` or come directly from `M`.
- Why it fails:
  The minimizing `N` is not forced to be a power of `3`; the optimal construction uses `N=2*3^(L-1)` and divisor `N/6`, which introduces factor `2`.
- Typical wrong outcome:
  Claims like `f(M) >= M` or “no better than near `M`,” which would give wrong `g(0)` and not answer `5`.

### 2) Treating the `{1,t,N}` family as globally optimal
- Pattern:
  Use `1+t+N=M`, derive `N = (k/(k+1))(M-1)`, then pick smallest feasible `k+1` (often `4`) and stop.
- Why it fails:
  This is only one solution family. It misses the better `N = (2/3)M` construction from `pq+p+q=3^s`.
- Typical wrong value:
  Candidate `f(M) = 3(M-1)/4` (too large).

### 3) Ignoring integrality constraints on denominator
- Pattern:
  Optimize `1 + 1/p + 1/q` as if `p=2,q=3` (`N/M=6/11`) were automatically admissible.
- Why it fails:
  `N = 6M/11` is not integer because `11` does not divide `M=3^L`.
- Typical wrong value:
  Infeasible candidate `f(M)=6M/11`.

### 4) Arithmetic/divisor mapping slips around `(p,q)=(3,6)`
- Pattern:
  Use the right pair `(3,6)` but sum the wrong divisor tuple (`N/2` with `N/3` or `N/6`).
- Why it fails:
  The valid triple is `N`, `N/3`, `N/6`, whose sum is `(3/2)N=M` when `N=2M/3`.
- Typical wrong outcome:
  Temporary contradictory sums (`11N/6`, `5N/3`) before correction.
