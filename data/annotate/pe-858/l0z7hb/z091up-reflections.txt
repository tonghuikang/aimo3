## Answer: correct (973077199)

## Key moments
- Token 53 [insight]: Sets up the core decomposition by grouping subsets via exact LCM values and Möbius-style counting.
- Token 735 [breakthrough]: Frames the counting subproblem as subset-intersection/hitting constraints over prime-power divisibility sets.
- Token 3346 [questionable statement]: Briefly conflates `d | lcm(S)` with “all elements are multiples of `d`,” then immediately questions it.
- Token 9743 [verification]: Reconfirms the base divisor-sum formula after earlier uncertainty, preventing a full derail.
- Token 15868 [insight]: Writes complement-size inclusion-exclusion in floor-sum form, which later becomes central.
- Token 17028 [mistake]: Performs an invalid exponent manipulation in a two-set union term (`2^{...}`), corrupting that branch.
- Token 24446 [questionable statement]: Claims the global sum factorizes as `∏_p F(p)`.
- Token 24510 [mistake]: Commits to that factorization, which is false because subset choices couple primes.
- Token 30740-34380 [wasted]: Long telescoping/identity attempts cycle without producing a computable algorithm.
- Token 40048 [verification]: Explicitly retracts a flawed convolution deduction (`G * id` path), resetting to sound ground.
- Token 49796 [insight]: Rewrites `p^{t_p}` via threshold indicator events `A_{p,e}`, enabling event-based inclusion-exclusion.
- Token 55134-55433 [wasted]: Extended sign/debug bookkeeping on term lists consumes effort without forward progress.
- Token 60247 [verification]: Checks a prime-index recurrence sanity case, validating local reasoning but not yet the full method.
- Token 65753 [insight]: Derives local `H_p(r)` structure, clarifying how primewise threshold terms should behave.
- Token 70840 [insight]: Reparameterizes by threshold selections `t_p` with explicit weights and union floors.
- Token 75908 [breakthrough]: Corrects union/complement counting with the proper multi-prime inclusion-exclusion floor formula.
- Token 80853 [insight]: Splits primes into saturated/unsaturated regimes and starts the small-prime vs large-prime decomposition.
- Token 85185 [missed opportunity]: Continues exploratory squarefree-number reformulations instead of implementing the now-viable decomposition immediately.
- Token 90570 [breakthrough]: Commits to a 9-small-prime exponent-vector state model plus large-prime bucket counts.
- Token 93071 [insight]: Defines precomputation of `C_L(e)` dominated-vector counts for `L=N` and each `L=N//p`.
- Token 94529 [breakthrough]: Major simplification: large-prime subset sum factorizes into per-prime terms `p*2^{extra} + (1-p)`.
- Token 96019 [insight]: Final implementation plan: mixed-radix indexing + prefix-count arrays over 340,200 states.
- Token 97015 [verification]: Implements prototype and validates against small-`N` checks (including the provided `N=20` benchmark).
- Token 98422 [verification]: Runs the full `N=800` computation after feasibility checks.
- Token 98709 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{973077199}`.
