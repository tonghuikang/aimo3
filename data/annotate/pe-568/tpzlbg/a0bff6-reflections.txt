## Answer: correct (28398)

## Key moments
- Token 455 [insight]: The trace frames the output format correctly as extracting the first 7 significant digits via scientific-notation scaling.
- Token 1435 [insight]: It models game B as matching two independent uniform size-\(k\) patterns after conditioning on exactly \(k\) lit bulbs.
- Token 2061 [breakthrough]: It derives the core difference formula \(D(n)=\sum_{k=1}^n \frac1k\left(\frac1{\binom nk}-\frac{\binom nk}{2^n}\right)\).
- Token 2438 [verification]: It numerically checks the \(n=6\) example and matches the prompt values.
- Token 2821 [questionable statement]: It asserts the asymptotics \(J_B\sim 1/n\) and \(J_A\sim 2/n\) strongly enough to predict the sign from heuristic leading terms.
- Token 3074 [mistake]: It concludes \(D(n)\) should be negative for large \(n\), which is contradicted by subsequent computed values.
- Token 3221 [verification]: It tests multiple \(n\) and confirms \(D(n)>0\) in sampled cases, forcing a rethink.
- Token 5638 [insight]: Pattern-checking across small \(n\) suggests \(D(n)2^n\) is tracking harmonic numbers.
- Token 5963 [breakthrough]: It states the exact identity \(D(n)=H_n/2^n\), turning the problem into a mantissa computation.
- Token 6652 [missed opportunity]: After finding the identity, it initially detours into large-power rearrangements instead of immediately using log-fractional-part mantissa extraction.
- Token 6652-8713 [wasted]: Extended big-exponent algebra and implementation planning does not materially advance beyond the already available logarithmic route.
- Token 12475 [breakthrough]: It computes the mantissa and obtains the 7-digit block \(4228020\), then proceeds to the modulo step.
- Token 12970 [verification]: It reruns the computation at higher precision to confirm the 7-digit block is stable.
- Token 13493 [final answer]: It commits to \(\boxed{28398}\), the correct modulo result.
