## Answer: correct (28398)

## Key moments
- Token 11 [insight]: The trace models one activation as a uniform bitstring / Binomial(n, 1/2), setting up both games with the same distributional base.
- Token 96 [breakthrough]: It correctly derives \(J_A(n)=\sum_{k=1}^n \Pr(X=k)/k=\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}/(2^n k)\).
- Token 486 [verification]: It checks \(J_A(6)\) numerically and matches the prompt value, confirming the game-A formula.
- Token 1043 [insight]: It identifies that in game B both terminal patterns are uniform over size-\(k\) subsets, so the match probability is \(1/\binom{n}{k}\).
- Token 1103 [breakthrough]: It translates that to \(J_B(n)=\sum_{k=1}^n 1/(k\binom{n}{k})\), giving the core expression for \(D(n)\).
- Token 1293 [verification]: It checks \(J_B(6)\) and matches the prompt, confirming the game-B derivation.
- Token 3235 [questionable statement]: It claims \(D(n)\) should be dominated by small-\(k\) terms and suggests a leading \(1/n\)-type behavior.
- Token 3725 [mistake]: It continues that path until explicit computation contradicts it (e.g., tiny \(D(100)\)), showing the dominance argument was incorrect.
- Token 5238-7735 [wasted]: A long algebraic/combinatorial detour tries multiple reformulations without resolving the cancellation structure.
- Token 7915 [insight]: It notices \(D(n)2^n\) matches sampled harmonic numbers, which points to a hidden exact identity.
- Token 8161 [breakthrough]: It states the key identity \(D(n)=H_n/2^n\), which unlocks a tractable logarithmic mantissa computation.
- Token 15370 [verification]: It recomputes the mantissa with higher precision and confirms stable leading digits \(4228020\), then applies modulo \(99991\).
- Token 21619 [final answer]: The trace outputs \(\boxed{28398}\), matching the required modulo answer.
