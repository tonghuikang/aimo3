## Answer: wrong (4228020)

## Key moments
- Token 360 [insight]: The trace correctly formalizes game A as a binomial-count event with reward \(1/k\).
- Token 1251 [insight]: It recognizes game B as matching two independent uniform subsets of size \(k\), giving match probability \(1/\binom nk\).
- Token 1438 [breakthrough]: It combines both games into \(D(n)=\sum_{k=1}^n \frac1k\left(\frac1{\binom nk}-\frac{\binom nk}{2^n}\right)\).
- Token 2031 [questionable statement]: It argues that endpoint terms dominate and starts treating \(D\) as roughly \(2/n\)-scale.
- Token 2368 [mistake]: It commits to the wrong asymptotic picture (near-\(2/n\)) and underestimates the cancellation structure.
- Token 4722 [verification]: Numeric checks for moderate \(n\) show rapid decay, contradicting the earlier scale assumption and forcing reevaluation.
- Token 10333 [missed opportunity]: Even after observing strong cancellation behavior, it pursues lengthy moment/cumulant asymptotics instead of first testing exact identities.
- Token 10333-17878 [wasted]: A long technical detour (series/cumulants/expansions) consumes many tokens without resolving the core structure.
- Token 17878 [insight]: It reframes the problem via high-precision evaluation of transformed sums, exposing a clean pattern in \(D(n)2^n\).
- Token 22004 [breakthrough]: It establishes the exact identity \(D(n)=H_n/2^n\), which directly enables mantissa extraction.
- Token 27042 [verification]: High-precision mantissa computation repeatedly returns leading digits \(4228020\).
- Token 29974 [verification]: Additional precision checks keep the leading block stable and explicitly compute the modulo value \(28398\).
- Token 31625 [questionable statement]: The final write-up narrows to reporting the 7-digit block and stops carrying the prompt’s “answer modulo 99991” requirement through to the boxed output.
- Token 31653 [mistake]: The trace boxes \(4228020\) (digits only) instead of the required modulo answer.
- Token 31653 [final answer]: It commits to \(\boxed{4228020}\), which is incorrect for the asked modulo output.
