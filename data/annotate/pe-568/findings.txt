# PE 568 Findings

## Correct Answer
- `28398`

## Correct Approach
- For game A:
  `J_A(n) = sum_{k=1}^n (1/k) * (C(n,k)/2^n)`.
- For game B:
  conditioning on "exactly k lights on" makes each final pattern uniform over the `C(n,k)` size-`k` subsets, so
  `J_B(n) = sum_{k=1}^n (1/k) * (1/C(n,k))`.
- Therefore
  `D(n) = sum_{k=1}^n (1/k) * (1/C(n,k) - C(n,k)/2^n)`.
- Exact simplification:
  `D(n) = H_n / 2^n`, where `H_n = sum_{k=1}^n 1/k` (harmonic number).
- For `n = 123456789`, compute
  `log10 D = log10(H_n) - n*log10(2)`
  (with `H_n` from Euler-Maclaurin / digamma), extract mantissa `m`, then the 7 leading digits are
  `floor(m * 10^6) = 4228020`.
- Problem asks for this 7-digit integer modulo `99991`:
  `4228020 mod 99991 = 28398`.

## Wrong Approaches And Why They Fail
- Treating `D(n)` as polynomial-scale (e.g., endpoint-dominant `~2/n` or other low-order asymptotics) misses the exact cancellation and gives the wrong magnitude.
- Doing long asymptotic/moment expansions without first using the exact identity `D(n)=H_n/2^n` adds complexity and often leads to unstable reasoning.
- Returning only the 7-digit block `4228020` is incomplete for this prompt; the required final output is the modulo value `28398`.
