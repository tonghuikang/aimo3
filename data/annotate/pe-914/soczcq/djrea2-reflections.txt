## Answer: correct (50612)

## Key moments
- Token 721 [insight]: Recognizes that for right triangles the minimal enclosing circle has radius `c/2`, so fitting strictly inside radius `R` means `c/2 < R`.
- Token 1720 [breakthrough]: Reformulates the task as maximizing `n(m-n)` with primitive constraints (`gcd(m,n)=1`, opposite parity) and `m^2+n^2 < 2R`.
- Token 1946 [verification]: Brute-force check at `R=100` returns `(36, (13,4))`, confirming the reduction matches the provided `F(100)=36`.
- Token 2520 [insight]: Sets up the continuous relaxation `f(x)=(x-1)/(x^2+1)` for `x=m/n` to locate where integer search should concentrate.
- Token 2732 [breakthrough]: Solves the derivative condition to get `x=1+sqrt(2)` and derives the target scale `F(R) ~ (sqrt(2)-1)R`, giving a concrete center for local search.
- Token 11918 [verification]: Implements the integer search in a neighborhood of `v0`, including strict-inequality handling plus parity and coprime filtering.
- Token 13296-15657 [wasted]: Long Pell-equation detour and repeated alternative justifications after a stable best candidate had already been obtained.
- Token 17499 [verification]: Expands to a much wider `±20,000,000` window and gets the same best pair, strengthening confidence in global optimality.
- Token 19521 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{50612}`.
