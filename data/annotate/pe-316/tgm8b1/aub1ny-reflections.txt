## Answer: correct (2602)

## Key moments
- Token 67 [insight]: Frames the task as first-occurrence expectation for a digit pattern and points toward border/autocorrelation structure.
- Token 1298 [questionable statement]: Treats `g(n)` directly as the end-time expectation `\sum 10^i` over borders, without adjusting for start index `k`.
- Token 1474 [mistake]: Computes `g(535)=1010` and interprets the sample (`1008`) as a discrepancy, caused by the missing start-index correction.
- Token 1598 [missed opportunity]: Could have used the problem’s `k` definition immediately to convert end position to start position by subtracting `(d-1)`.
- Token 2176 [breakthrough]: Correctly distinguishes end index vs start index and derives `g(n)=E[\text{end}]-(d-1)`.
- Token 2605 [verification]: Rechecks `535` with the corrected formula and matches the prompt value `1008`.
- Token 3466-3847 [wasted]: Spends substantial effort debating distinct quotient counts and asymptotics even though direct iteration over `n=2..999999` is already tractable.
- Token 5821 [verification]: Reproduces the given benchmark `\sum_{n=2}^{999} g(\lfloor 10^6/n \rfloor)=27280188`, validating the implementation.
- Token 6502 [verification]: Runs the target computation and gets modulo result `2602`.
- Token 8230 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{2602}`, which is correct.
