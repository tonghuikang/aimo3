## Answer: correct (84047)

## Key moments
- Token 1314 [insight]: Starts using computed small cases to infer structure instead of staying in blind symbolic manipulation.
- Token 2719 [insight]: Notices the empirical invariant `g(n) = -n` for odd `n`, setting up the core proof target.
- Token 3044 [questionable statement]: Tries pairing `i` with `n+1-i` and assumes their parities are opposite.
- Token 3044 [mistake]: The parity claim for `n+1-i` is wrong when `n` is odd, so this cancellation path is invalid.
- Token 3508 [breakthrough]: Switches to pairing `i` with `n-i`, which does have opposite parity and equal gcd contribution.
- Token 3631 [breakthrough]: Completes the odd-`n` proof that all pairs cancel except `i=n`, yielding `g(n)=-n`.
- Token 4475 [missed opportunity]: After a correct odd-case proof, it returns to ad-hoc experimentation for even cases instead of immediately formalizing divisor-counting.
- Token 4475-6549 [wasted]: Extended sequence-guessing and speculative fitting for `g(2k)`/`g(2^e)` before committing to a general framework.
- Token 6749 [insight]: Re-centers on 2-adic valuation and the decomposition `n = 2^e m` with odd `m`.
- Token 14798 [breakthrough]: Obtains and validates a closed form for `g(2^p)`, locking down the pure 2-power component.
- Token 18378 [insight]: Rewrites `G(N)` as odd-part plus even-part contributions, simplifying the global objective.
- Token 20268 [insight]: Uses periodicity modulo odd `m` and block decomposition to separate odd-part behavior from 2-adic weights.
- Token 26937 [breakthrough]: Derives `g(2k)=(A-L)\Sigma`, then `g(2^e m)=B(e)\,t(m)` for odd `m`.
- Token 29833 [breakthrough]: Final decomposition of `g`/`G` into `B(e)` and `S(\lfloor N/2^e\rfloor)` makes large-`N` computation feasible.
- Token 34765-41233 [wasted]: Re-derives `t(m)` through a second route after enough formulas already existed to proceed with implementation.
- Token 43502 [verification]: Validates the computation pipeline against the provided checkpoint `G(1234)=2194708`.
- Token 43640 [verification]: Recomputes full `G(12345678)` and rechecks modulo consistency.
- Token 43861 [final answer]: Commits to `84047` (correct).
