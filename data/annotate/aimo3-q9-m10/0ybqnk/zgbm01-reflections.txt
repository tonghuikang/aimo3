## Answer: correct (270)

## Key moments
- Token 1667 [insight]: Moves to generating functions and rewrites the condition as a product that should equal a two-monomial signal.
- Token 2416 [breakthrough]: Reduces the problem to Laurent divisibility of \(1+x^d\) (equivalently divisibility of a binomial up to monomial units).
- Token 6421 [breakthrough]: Derives the structural constraint that valid cyclotomic indices must share a common \(v_2\)-level and can be realized via a suitable \(d\).
- Token 15252 [verification]: Sets the correct counting framework: same-\(b\) subsets, degree cap, shifts \(0\ldots 10-\deg(P)\), and global sign factor.
- Token 16536 [verification]: Executes enumeration and gets the target total \(270\).
- Token 16905-20624 [wasted]: Long repeated completeness/consistency discussion after the core count is already settled.
- Token 22730 [questionable statement]: Attempts to validate with ordinary polynomial divisibility by \(\alpha\), which ignores allowed Laurent monomial offsets.
- Token 22854 [mistake]: This incorrect check reports false failures for valid shifted forms \(x^rP(x)\).
- Token 23455 [breakthrough]: Fixes validation by testing Laurent divisibility (\(\alpha=x^rP\) with an \(x^{-r}\) compensation), restoring consistency.
- Token 23715 [final answer]: Concludes with \(\boxed{270}\), which is correct.
