## Answer: correct (270)

## Key moments
- Token 1865 [insight]: Reformulates the condition as a Laurent-polynomial divisibility equation \(A(x)B_{\mathrm{rev}}(x)=x^k+x^l\).
- Token 6421 [breakthrough]: Identifies the key structure: admissible cyclotomic factors for one \(d\) all share the same \(v_2\), and any such subset can be realized.
- Token 8982 [verification]: Switches to degree-limited subset counting (\(\deg D\le 10\)) group-by-group in \(v_2\)-classes.
- Token 13532 [verification]: Implements enumeration and gets the base shift-sum \(135\), then applies global sign doubling to reach \(270\).
- Token 14468 [verification]: Explicitly proves every enumerated \(D\) divides some \(1+x^d\) via \(d=2^{e-1}\operatorname{lcm}(\text{odd parts})\).
- Token 16956-19724 [wasted]: Repeats multiple completeness and uniqueness checks after the count is already established.
- Token 21217 [verification]: Runs additional code checks (uniform \(v_2\), valid \(d\), constructible \(\beta\)) to validate realizability.
- Token 25060 [final answer]: Confirms and outputs \(\boxed{270}\), which is correct.
