Correct answer: 270

Correct approach:
Represent \(\alpha\) by \(A(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{10}\alpha(i)x^i\) and define \(B_{\mathrm{rev}}(x)=\sum_t \beta(t)x^{-t}\).  
Then \(S_n(\alpha)\star\beta\) is the coefficient of \(x^n\) in \(A(x)B_{\mathrm{rev}}(x)\), so the condition is equivalent to
\[
A(x)B_{\mathrm{rev}}(x)=x^k+x^l=x^k(1+x^d),\quad d=|l-k|>0.
\]
Hence \(A\) must divide a binomial in \(\mathbb Z[x,x^{-1}]\), so
\[
A(x)=\pm x^r P(x),
\]
where \(P(x)\) divides \(1+x^d\) in \(\mathbb Z[x]\) for some \(d\).

For \(d=2^a u\) (\(u\) odd),
\[
1+x^d=\prod_{m\mid u}\Phi_{2^{a+1}m}(x).
\]
So every cyclotomic index in \(P\) must have the same \(v_2\) value (same 2-adic level).  
With degree bound \(\deg A\le 10\), relevant even indices are:
\[
\{2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,30\}.
\]
Grouped by \(v_2\):
- \(v_2=1\): \(2,6,10,14,18,22,30\) with degrees \(1,2,4,6,6,10,8\)
- \(v_2=2\): \(4,12,20\) with degrees \(2,4,8\)
- \(v_2=3\): \(8,24\) with degrees \(4,8\)
- \(v_2=4\): \(16\) with degree \(8\)

Count subsets within one group only, with total degree \(\le 10\):
- nonempty counts: \(21+5+2+1=29\)
- plus empty subset \(P=1\): total \(30\) possible \(P\).

For each \(P\) of degree \(D\), shifts \(r=0,\dots,10-D\) give \(11-D\) choices.  
Summing over all 30 base \(P\) gives \(135\) positive-sign \(A\).  
Both signs are valid (\(-\alpha\) is shifty via \(-\beta\)), so total:
\[
2\times 135=270.
\]

Wrong approaches and why they fail:
- Overcount to 544: treating any subset of the 13 even-index cyclotomics with degree \(\le 10\) as valid. This ignores the same-\(v_2\) requirement for factors of one fixed \(1+x^d\).
- Undercount to 135: counting only \(+x^rP\) and forgetting global sign variants \(-x^rP\), which are also shifty.
- False rejection of valid shifted forms: checking polynomial divisibility \( (1+x^d)/\alpha\in\mathbb Z[x]\) directly for \(\alpha=x^rP\). Correct condition is Laurent divisibility: \(x^{-r}(1+x^d)/P\in\mathbb Z[x,x^{-1}]\).
