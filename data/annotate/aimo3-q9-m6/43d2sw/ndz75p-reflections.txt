## Answer: correct (84)

## Key moments
- Token 1870 [insight]: Moves to generating functions, turning the shift-inner-product condition into polynomial multiplication.
- Token 9048 [breakthrough]: Establishes the necessity/sufficiency reduction to `A(x)=x^sB(x)` with `B| (1+x^d)`.
- Token 14886 [insight]: Identifies the key structural restriction: factors in one divisor must share a single 2-adic exponent class.
- Token 15531-15880 [wasted]: Spends time on broad brute-force strategy discussion that is not needed once the divisor classification is in place.
- Token 16992 [breakthrough]: Starts the concrete grouped enumeration of admissible cyclotomic factors by `v2` class and degree.
- Token 22331 [verification]: Checks that each same-`v2` subset can be realized by a suitable odd-part choice in `d`.
- Token 27529 [verification]: Computes the normalized count `42` and then applies sign symmetry to reach `84`.
- Token 32029 [verification]: Confirms computationally that the full generated family has size `84` and satisfies the condition.
- Token 34779 [final answer]: Finalizes `\boxed{84}`, which is correct.
