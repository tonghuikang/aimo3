## Answer: correct (84)

## Key moments
- Token 1796 [insight]: Recasts the correlation condition into polynomial/generating-function language.
- Token 2334 [breakthrough]: Writes the target factorization `A(x)B'(x)=x^k+x^l`, reducing the task to divisor structure.
- Token 8954 [insight]: Explicitly frames necessity and sufficiency around divisors of `1+x^d` plus monomial shifts.
- Token 14984 [breakthrough]: Locks the core structural rule that admissible cyclotomic factors must come from one shared 2-adic class.
- Token 17383-17746 [wasted]: Additional exhaustive-construction discussion adds little after the classification is already complete.
- Token 19168 [verification]: Applies the shift/sign multiplicity formula over the valid base-polynomial set.
- Token 20362 [verification]: Numeric check confirms the aggregate count reaches `84`.
- Token 26054 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{84}`, which is correct.
