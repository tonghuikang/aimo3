## Answer: wrong (130)

## Key moments
- Token 1631 [insight]: Converts the correlation requirement into Laurent-polynomial multiplication.
- Token 3522 [missed opportunity]: Notes that `x-1` does not divide `x^d+1`, but this constraint is not carried into the later candidate construction.
- Token 5135 [breakthrough]: Correctly reduces candidates to forms `A(x)=x^pD(x)` with `D` dividing some `x^d+1`.
- Token 8930 [questionable statement]: Begins admitting odd-index cyclotomic factors into the candidate pool.
- Token 11132 [questionable statement]: Creates a `v2=0` factor group, which is incompatible with divisors of `x^d+1`.
- Token 12117 [mistake]: Counts subsets including odd-index factors (e.g., `\Phi_1,\Phi_3,\Phi_5,...`) that cannot appear in `x^d+1`.
- Token 15385 [mistake]: Explicitly treats `x-1` and other odd-index-derived products as valid `D`, inflating the family.
- Token 18758-19182 [wasted]: Additional validation discussion occurs after the invalid factor family is already fixed, so it cannot correct the count.
- Token 20597 [verification]: Arithmetic on degree buckets is internally consistent but verifies the wrong candidate set.
- Token 20823 [final answer]: Finalizes `\boxed{130}`, which is incorrect.
