## Answer: wrong (26)

## Key moments
- Token 1588 [insight]: Reframes the condition in the Laurent-polynomial/group-ring model so the correlation target becomes a factorization question.
- Token 1971 [breakthrough]: Correctly states the core equivalence: shifty means the trace’s polynomial must divide a two-monomial target in `\mathbb{Z}[x,x^{-1}]`.
- Token 2166 [questionable statement]: Normalizes by shifting away the minimal exponent and treats absolute placement as irrelevant for counting `\alpha`.
- Token 3507-7800 [wasted]: Long cyclotomic/totient enumeration is detailed but does not resolve how support placement inside `[0,6]` should be counted.
- Token 5050 [questionable statement]: Imposes `A(0)=\pm1` as if every valid `A` must be a direct divisor of `x^d+1`, quietly excluding shifted forms `x^cQ(x)`.
- Token 11913 [insight]: Starts structured low-degree cyclotomic enumeration, which is the right counting backbone.
- Token 15325 [verification]: Checks that factors used together must share one fixed 2-adic exponent for a single `x^d+1`.
- Token 24321 [mistake]: Counts only normalized divisor shapes and drops the positional multiplicity from allowed shifts `c` with `c+\deg(Q)\le 6`.
- Token 24321 [missed opportunity]: At this point it could have switched to counting `(Q,c)` pairs, which would have fixed the undercount immediately.
- Token 24487 [verification]: Performs subset casework checks, but only within the reduced model, so the check cannot detect the missing shift factor.
- Token 24589 [mistake]: Commits to `13` base polynomials and doubles by sign to `26`, propagating the earlier structural undercount.
- Token 24649 [final answer]: Finalizes `\boxed{26}`, which is incorrect.
