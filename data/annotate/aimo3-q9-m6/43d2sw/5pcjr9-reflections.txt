## Answer: wrong (118)

## Key moments
- Token 990 [insight]: Moves from raw shift-dot-product equations to the group-ring/polynomial viewpoint.
- Token 2171 [breakthrough]: Correctly identifies the core condition as a normalized divisor relation with `1+x^d`.
- Token 6184 [questionable statement]: Assumes any even-index cyclotomic factor can be freely combined for one divisor model.
- Token 7105 [questionable statement]: Recasts the task as counting all subsets of the eight low-degree even cyclotomics, without enforcing one common 2-adic class.
- Token 8770 [mistake]: Treats all degree-feasible subsets as valid divisors, including combinations that cannot divide the same `x^d+1`.
- Token 9290-10523 [wasted]: Python subset counting is applied to the over-broad candidate family, so computation reinforces the wrong model.
- Token 10516 [mistake]: Locks in the inflated total `118` from the invalid subset universe.
- Token 11259 [missed opportunity]: Could have filtered subsets by a single shared `v2` value before counting, which would have corrected the result.
- Token 11506 [verification]: Internal arithmetic checks are consistent, but only for the already overcounted list.
- Token 12091 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{118}`, which is incorrect.
