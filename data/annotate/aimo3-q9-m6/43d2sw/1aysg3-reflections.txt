## Answer: wrong (26)

## Key moments
- Token 1753 [insight]: Converts the correlation condition into a polynomial product condition in the Laurent setting.
- Token 2586 [breakthrough]: Reaches the key reduction that the normalized core factor must divide `1+x^d` for some `d>0`.
- Token 3284 [questionable statement]: Treats the divisor as forced to have nonzero constant term in a way that rules out valid shifted forms of `\alpha`.
- Token 12594 [missed opportunity]: Could have introduced the multiplicity factor `7-\deg(B)` here but never does.
- Token 12645 [questionable statement]: Starts counting only monic divisor shapes and not `(shape, shift)` realizations inside `[0,6]`.
- Token 12645 [mistake]: Under-counts by collapsing all placements of the same base polynomial into one object.
- Token 13113 [mistake]: Final counting step hard-commits to `2*13=26`, carrying the earlier omission through to the end.
- Token 13944 [verification]: Performs duplicate checks among listed polynomials, but only within the already under-complete candidate set.
- Token 15442-16258 [wasted]: Long brute-force/plausibility digression does not repair the missing shift dimension.
- Token 24296 [final answer]: Ends with the boxed value `26`, which is incorrect.
