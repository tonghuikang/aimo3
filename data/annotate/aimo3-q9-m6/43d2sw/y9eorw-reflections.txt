## Answer: correct (84)

## Key moments
- Token 1081 [insight]: Sets up the convolution/correlation equivalence with a reversed beta sequence.
- Token 1214 [breakthrough]: Expresses the target as `\alpha*c=\delta_k+\delta_l`, enabling algebraic factor reasoning.
- Token 2571 [questionable statement]: Starts a support-sumset route that assumes strong combinatorial restrictions before using full polynomial divisibility.
- Token 2571-4131 [wasted]: Extended sumset case analysis is explored but does not produce the final counting framework.
- Token 4537 [mistake]: Over-narrows to special small-support alpha patterns (scaled-shift arguments), which is incomplete for the full solution space.
- Token 10863 [insight]: Returns to the divisor-of-`1+x^d` classification, restoring the general path.
- Token 14984 [breakthrough]: Enforces the shared-`v2` factor condition and valid subgroup-based divisor construction.
- Token 19168 [verification]: Applies shift multiplicity and sign doubling on the valid base family.
- Token 20362 [verification]: Numeric aggregation confirms the total reaches `84`.
- Token 27856 [final answer]: Finalizes `\boxed{84}`, which is correct.
