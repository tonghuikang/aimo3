## Answer: wrong (38637)

## Key moments
- Token 81 [insight]: Sets up the direct-summand/projection view of integer idempotents and reduces counting to rank cases.
- Token 2514 [questionable statement]: Assumes rank-1 and rank-2 counts are symmetric under `M \mapsto I-M` without accounting for box-bound asymmetry on diagonals.
- Token 5046 [mistake]: Uses the incorrect simplification `C(n)=2+#pairs`, which overcounts at `n=1`.
- Token 6328 [verification]: Brute-force comparison at `n=1` exposes the mismatch (`176` implied vs `164` given).
- Token 8673 [breakthrough]: Corrects the structure to `C(n)=2+N1(n)+N2(n)` and separates rank-2 constraints explicitly.
- Token 8898 [insight]: Rewrites rank-2 feasibility as rank-1 matrices where `I-M` also stays within bounds, focusing on diagonal failure cases.
- Token 15639-23181 [wasted]: Extended asymptotic/generating-function exploration delays implementation without adding decisive counting constraints.
- Token 24224 [questionable statement]: Compresses the rank-2 correction into a single diagonal-event counting scheme with aggressive multiplicity assumptions.
- Token 26914 [mistake]: Commits to `D = 6 * \sum_{A|n} [t^{n+1}] G_{A,B}(t)^2`; this correction fits tiny checks but is incomplete for larger `n`.
- Token 33424 [verification]: Confirms the implemented formula reproduces `C(1)` and `C(2)`, but only on the two provided calibration points.
- Token 37069 [missed opportunity]: Stops validation at `n=1,2` despite the multi-stage derivation and no independent large-`n` cross-check.
- Token 42574 [final answer]: Commits to `\boxed{38637}`.
